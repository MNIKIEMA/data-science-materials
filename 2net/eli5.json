If you use nesquick, it does not have emulsifiers, and should not have a similar milk absorbance to store-bought chocky milkEDIT: I'm gonna add a few more notes after seeing the comments below. note - I'm from the US so if milk is different in different countries than I apologize, but this is true for the US.1: Why doesn't regular milk need emulsified?when you buy milk from the store its pasteurized and homogenized.The pasteurization kills bacteria to keep the milk safe to drink.The homogenization takes the milk fat globules and reduces them in size and to be uniformly dispersed through the rest of the milk. Without this process, the milk would separate.2: Why and what are emulsifersChocolate milk has emulsifiers. These are chemicals that keep the chocolate in the milk evenly mixed and prevent settling of be chocolate. This is why store bought chocolate milk taste better because emulsifiers are fatty and delicious but not healthy so people would rather mix healthier chocolate powderThe emulsifiers will combine with the milk particles to make bigger combinations of molecules. This is not a chemical reaction, but caused by the polarities of molecules bringing them together and keeping them mixed up well. This bigger molecules will not go into the oreo, as the milk is not easy to get away from its surrounded molecules, and the emulsifiers to do permeate the cookie. These emulsifiers will also raise surface tension which makes it harder for the milk to permeate the cookie.The egg used when baking is an emulsifer to get everything to mix together when they normally wouldn't want to.I don't know how to type it on reddit but this is where you would have likeFe2S03 DOT 6H20, where the molecule has 6 water molecules around it, but they aren't chemically combined.3: Why is store bought chocolate milk emulsified when homemade chocolate milk is not Premade chocolate milk needs to be emulsified because its shipped, kept in stores, and not drank all at once at your house.Regular milk doesn't need emulsified because its homogenized which is a different chemical process that keeps the milk particles suspended.Homemade chocolate milk will settle if it sits on your counter for a long time. This doesn't matter that much since you just make one cup at a time.4: Explain this to a five year old Chocolate milk from the store is milk with chocolate. Chocolate and milk are different so if they sit in the same container for a long time, the chocolate will fall to the bottom. That's why homemade chocolate milk will separate into a layer of chocolate at the bottom and milk at the top if you let it sit out for a long time.  Store bought chocolate milk needs to stay mixed because people don't want to buy chocolate milk if its separated. Since storebought chocolate milk is manufactured, shipped to a store, held there, purchased, brought home, and drank later, it needs to stay mixed for days or weeks.  This can be done using chemicals that keep the chocolate mixed evenly in the milk. These chemicals are tasty, but not healthy, and called emulsifiers. These will keep the chocolate mixed up for a long time. Regular milk doesn't need this because homogenization is an action done to milk to keep it mixed evenly. Homogenization means making the whole gallon uniform."}, {"date": "04/02/20", "score": 1800, "text": "My mind is blown that this is a thing."}, {"date": "04/02/20", "score": 201, "text": "Thanks! Not only did you answer my question, but you also gave me hope for the future!"}, {"date": "04/02/20", "score": 22, "text": "Master student food physics here. I don't know if emulsifiers have anything to do with this phenomenon, but I do know that there are some factual inconsistencies in this story.Let's start with an emulsion. An emulsion is a mixture of two or more immiscible liquids - for example oil and water. One is called the continuous phase, the other the dispersed phase. Milk for example is an emulsion of fat droplets in water, where the fat is the dispersed phase and water the continuous phase. You could also have an emulsion of water droplets (dispersed phase) in a continuous oil phase.Any mixture of fat and water will show phase separation, because they are immiscible and it is thermodynamically unfavourable to have a large interfacial area (the area where oil and water touch) between the two liquids. So what you see when you mix pure oil with pure water is that the two phases will separate very quickly, also if you homogenize the mixture. There is an interfacial tension between the two liquids that causes this. Luckily, nature found a way to prevent this phenomenon by using a molecule that can 'link' the two phases. Those molecules are called emulsifiers and they lower (not increase) the interfacial tension. Proteins, for example, can be emulsifiers. Also synthetic molecules can be emulsifiers, as long as they interact with both the oil and the water. Milk does not show phase separation (at least, very slow that is) because the proteins in milk keep this from happening. The very small fat droplets are covered by proteins, so that droplets repel each other, cannot merge, and therefore do not form one big fat layer on top of your milk. However, if you let your milk stand for a year (without any evaporation of the water) you will see a fat layer forming. Mixtures of immiscible fluids are always an unfavourable state to be in, so they will eventually show phase separation.Just like normal milk, chocolate milk has emulsifiers in there to 'stabilize' the interface between the water and chocolate fat droplets. Liquid chocolate milk usually does not contain additional emulsifiers, because skimmed milk is enriched with cocoa fat and the free proteins in the milk will act as emulsifiers for the added fat. Chocolate milk powder, such as Nesquick, usually contains lecithin, which is a molecule in egg yolk. You also use this emulsifier when making mayonnaise. The ingredients for mayonnaise are: water, oil, vinegar and egg yolks. Without the egg yolks, your mayonnaise will very rapidly show two separate layers: one oil layer and one water and vinegar layer.Emulsifiers are only needed in very very low quantities, so therefore they do not significantly influence the taste of products. It is also not true that they taste fatty per se. Proteins can be emulsifiers and they are usually not perceived to be fatty.What is the reason for the phenomenon you describe, I don't know. It could have to do with the higher viscosity of chocolate milk or a lot of other things. But it is not directly caused by the use of different emulsifiers.TL;DR: emulsifiers link immiscible liquids and can make them appear miscible for a long time, while every mixture of oil and water will separate eventually. Milk contains proteins that act as emulsifier and chocolate milk contains those proteins and/or lecithin, a compound in egg yolk. Emulsifiers are not the cause of the phenomenon that OP describes."}, {"date": "04/02/20", "score": 16, "text": "Huh, never dunked an Oreo in chocolate milk.

You know how when your pan is really hot and you put in pancake batter, it cooks the outside really fast? And then you can flip it, but it does the same thing to the other side and the middle doesn\u2019t cook very well? 90% alcohol is like that. It doesn\u2019t penetrate well into cells or clumps of microbes because it just fries everything it touches on the outside. The 70% alcohol is like cooking on medium heat with a moderately hot pan. It contacts the outside, too, but the water helps it penetrate to cook the inside (denature proteins deeper) as well.From https://blog.gotopac.com/2017/05/15/why-is-70-isopropyl-alcohol-ipa-a-better-disinfectant-than-99-isopropanol-and-what-is-ipa-used-for/The presence of water is a crucial factor in destroying or inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microorganisms with isopropyl alcohol. Water acts as a catalyst and plays a key role in denaturing the proteins of vegetative cell membranes. 70% IPA solutions penetrate the cell wall more completely which permeates the entire cell, coagulates all proteins, and therefore the microorganism dies. Extra water content slows evaporation, therefore increasing surface contact time and enhancing effectiveness. Isopropyl alcohol concentrations over 91% coagulate proteins instantly. Consequently, a protective layer is created which protects other proteins from further coagulation.Solutions > 91% IPA may kill some bacteria, but require longer contact times for disinfection, and enable spores to lie in a dormant state without being killed. A 50% isopropyl alcohol solution kills Staphylococcus Aureus in less than 10 seconds (pg. 238), yet a 90% solution with a contact time of over two hours is ineffective.Edit: Because there\u2019s been some confusion, I\u2019d like to add two points. First, higher concentrations of alcohol solutions (specifically isopropyl) may still be superior as solvents, for use on things like electronics for cleaning, because water is generally bad for electronics. Second, what we\u2019re talking about above you should think of as referring only to ethanol and isopropyl alcohol (which is not safe to consume). There are other alcohols but we\u2019re just sticking to the ones commonly used.Edit 2: Some people have questioned the source, which is good and part of science. The source offered a decent write-up of what numerous PhD mentors have taught me, and it\u2019s consistent with the science. At the risk of making this too long, here\u2019s what the CDC has to say, from https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/disinfection/disinfection-methods/chemical.htmlAdding water enhances effectiveness of isopropyl and ethyl alcohols:The most feasible explanation for the antimicrobial action of alcohol is denaturation of proteins. This mechanism is supported by the observation that absolute ethyl alcohol, a dehydrating agent, is less bactericidal than mixtures of alcohol and water because proteins are denatured more quickly in the presence of waterIsopropanol and ethanol effective bactericidesThe bactericidal activity of various concentrations of ethyl alcohol (ethanol) was examined against a variety of microorganisms in exposure periods ranging from 10 seconds to 1 hour 483. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was killed in 10 seconds by all concentrations of ethanol from 30% to 100% (v/v), and Serratia marcescens, E, coli and Salmonella typhosa were killed in 10 seconds by all concentrations of ethanol from 40% to 100%. The gram-positive organisms Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were slightly more resistant, being killed in 10 seconds by ethyl alcohol concentrations of 60%\u201395%. Isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol) was slightly more bactericidal than ethyl alcohol for E. coli and S. aureus 489.Kills viruses at these concentrationsEthyl alcohol, at concentrations of 60%\u201380%, is a potent virucidal agent inactivating all of the lipophilic viruses (e.g., herpes, vaccinia, and influenza virus) and many hydrophilic viruses (e.g., adenovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, and rotaviruses but not hepatitis A virus (HAV) 58 or poliovirus) 49.Isopropanol similar to chlorhexidine https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0195670183900257"}, {"date": "24/01/20", "score": 3300, "text": "Very nice analogy.

Adding a material different than the container, such as a spoon or piece of spaghetti, to the hottest region of the pot (nearest the stove), gives the water an irregular area where bubbles can more easily form.In extreme cases, water can become superheated and the smallest vibration or something falling into the container can cause it to explosively come to a boil and geyser out of the container.A similar effect can be seen in candymaking.  You can have a supersaturated sugar solution that stays liquid.  Drop a few grains of solid sugar into the pot or scratch the side of the pot with a spoon and the whole thing suddenly crystallizes because you\u2019ve provided nucleation sites.EDIT TO COLLECT THE ANSWERS TO THE MOST COMMON FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:What?Nucleation sites are where the change of state (liq->solid or liq->gas) occurs.When everything is exactly the same, it can be hard for such a site to appear.  However, if there are slight (microscopic) impurities, these can disturb the system just enough to lower the energy for the phase change.If you have very pure water and keep adding heat uniformly (such as a microwave), everywhere in the solution has the same energy and no one area preferentially wants to become the first bubble site.If you have a supersaturated sugar solution, it wants to crystallize because it is too saturated but no one area preferentially wants to form that first seed crystal.You can help such a system by disturbing it and giving it that first area that is slightly different where the phase change can start.  After that, the disturbance spreads as bubbles form or sugar crystals form.How can I fix my cookware to prevent this or why don\u2019t manufacturers do something about this?Usually, you shouldn\u2019t have to force this disturbance.  Your cooking pot, beer glass or mixing bowl already has micro scratches on the surface.  Boiling, carbonation bubbles or sugar crystals all start on these without help, most of the time.If you want to control where your water boils, in an attempt prevent boil overs, cookware companies make ceramic \u201cpot minders\u201d that cause most/all of the bubbles to form on the surface of the ceramic, instead of across the whole bottom of the pot.Some beer and sparkling wine companies make glasses with intentional etching on them.  This causes most of the carbonation bubbles to form in a certain pleasing place and stream to the top, instead of forming randomly all over the inside of the glass like you see in Sprite ads.Is this the same thing that causes rapid freezing when you touch a water bottle you forgot in your car in the cold?Yes.  The water was ready to freeze, it just needed a small disturbance to break the stalemate of where the first ice crystal would form.Is this the same thing that causes mugs of microwaved water to becomes traps for the unwary when they go to add powdered coffee or teabags?Yes.

This oxygen-less heating process is called pyrolysis.Activated charcoal or activated carbon is charcoal that has been treated to create lots of small holes/pores within the structure of the charcoal. These microscopic holes increase the surface area. This gives the activated carbon more area to bind to things and lock them up, which is why activated carbon is useful for purification purposes.

This includes the physical decomposition of metals but it also includes the deposit of new metal which can cause short circuits.Changing capacitance and affecting the flow of electrons.Pure water is not very conductive and in a pure environment it would not cause much damage if any. However in the real world the water is seldom pure and these impurities make the water conductive.Conductive liquid covering your circuits can change the capacitance of components which destabilizes the circuit and it can even lead to damage. It can also cause electrons to bridge a gap between two points it wasn't designed for if they are close enough together, the water is conductive enough, and the voltage potential is high enough. Thus current can move through a circuit in a way it wasn't designed for and damage it. These are the reasons why it's bad to try to turn on a wet device, and why a device which is powered off can get wet and be dried out later without failing.In addition, there are the corrosive effects. Water causes rust and oxidation, particularly in iron compounds like chokes, inductors, and transformers. There is also electrolysis to contend with. When you put 2 different metals in a conductive solution, ions can flow from one to the other which causes material to be deposited at one end, and corroded from the other. The material deposited may short circuit the tiny legs of integrated circuits, it may rapidly corrode other components which can lead to shorts and breaks.Remember how tiny everything is now days and how delicate the little metal legs and traces are that connect chips to each other. It only takes a few seconds of corrosion to dissolve part of a trace or short circuit 2 tiny wires thinner than a human hair.Even if the device is powered down, if it is left wet long enough it can still corrode due to the difference in potential between different metals, a bit like how a battery works."}, {"date": "21/02/20", "score": 9, "text": "This is a pretty good eli5, but I feel it could be simplified.Electronics depend on electricity going where we want it to go.  Unless it's VERY pure water will act as a conductor causing it to go places it shouldn't.

If it's not too bad it may still work, especially if an expert cleans it.

Lets use the most obvious one and picture a journey in a car. Your fuel consumption is going to be based primarily on 4 things.Distance - This is major factor in this. If you go further, you need more fuel. A shorter trip means less fuel.2)The effectiveness of the engine consuming fuel. Different cars have different engines and not all are as good at turning the fuel into power as the others.3) The weight of the car (including all the passengers and the fuel). The more weight you have the more energy you need to put in to get the vehicle moving. This in turn uses more fuel.4) Drag. This is more specifically what you were asking about, as this is what causes extra fuel consumption at higher speeds.  It may look like theirs nothing in the way ahead of a car, but it does actually have to move the air in its path out of the way. The faster you are going the more air you are displacing every second. As the car \"pushes\" the air out of the way , the air also pushes back against the car, effectively slowing it down. So you have to apply more force to counter the air moved. This again costs energy to do. and increases fuel consumption.and just to add more to this in the case of driving. Driver behaviour changes fuel consumption. It is much much much less efficient to keep accelerating and slowing down than it is to just keep a constant speed (assuming they average to the same speed). So people who drive really fast and then keep stopping at reds are just wasting fuel. And to go even further.... most car manufacturers have and make available information about the most economic/efficient speed for their cars. Meaning they have worked out the best constant speed to keep to, to minimise fuel consumption."}]}, {"question": "ELI5: The differences between glucose, sucrose, lactose, fructose, and all of the other \"-oses.\"", "author_name": "clburton24", "date": "23/02/20", "flair": "Chemistry", "answers": [{"date": "25/12/19", "score": 2100, "text": "Ok I\u2019ll try to explain with some details but keep it ELI5.All sugars \u201clook\u201d similar if you get really really close to them using a super microscope.But they are still a bit different.First there are little simple sugars or \u201cmonosaccharides\u201d.

This one is intentional though, since most mammals stop drinking milk after infancy.As stated above lactose breaks down to glucose and galactose. The glucose is no problem, but the galactose has to be converted to glucose before it can be broken down, and that process requires energy (making the energy you get from the sugar less efficient). The production of one specific enzyme (lactase) is naturally shut off after infancy (or later depending on genetic and dietary factors) to help be the most energy efficient when digesting food.Luckily because the cause for lactose intolerance is well known and consistent across most people, you can buy over-the-counter supplement pills (like lactaid) that have the enzyme your body no longer makes.

That control area is connected to other control area by power lines called tie lines. Each control area may buy or sell power over those tie lines. There is an assumption that the rest of the grid outside of the tie lines is infinite, or nearly. Meaning it can either absorb over generation, or make up for under generation in the control area.Assume for a moment the control area is not buying or selling power. If the control area is generating exactly what the users demand, the net flow over the tie lines will be zero. So from a real time power control standpoint the computers in the control area monitor the net power flow on the tie lines (called the area control error). If power is flowing into the control area, then that means the supply is less than demand, and the computers will bump up the output of certain generators in the system based on economics and their ability to regulate. And the opposite is true if over generating. In the systems I worked on this was done every 4 seconds.Of course the grid is not infinite in real life. If every control area on the grid was under generating, they would all be quite happy with their area control error, but the grid frequency would drop.

Because if they produce to little, our appliances won't work, if they produce to much, our appliances will fry :). The power grid has a constant frequency of 50 or 60 Hz, depending on where you live. The generators in a power plant run at a certain speed to maintain that exact frequency and all power plants are in sync. However, if we start using more power than they are producing, the frequency will drop slightly, to 49.9 for example. This is a trigger for the power plant that they are not producing enough, and they will then turn up the gas a bit, increase their production and try to get it back to 50 Hz. If we use less than they are producing, the frequency goes up a bit, to 50.1 for example. This triggers them to reduce power.Different types of power plants have different reactiontimes, a gas plant can increase or decrease production very vast, coal takes more time (minutes, hours), nuclear even more (hours, days) and some we can't really control, like solar and wind, those we can only disconnect from the grid if we want to reduce their production.Overal the power companies will forecast how much they expect to be needed to be produced. This is done based on historical data, weather forecasts and trading of electricity. For example on a hot summerday they expect more power to be required for airconditioning. And large (industrial) power consumers need to tell the power company what they are going to use the next day (sometimes up until hourly or even smaller time frames) they call this nomination. All this information gives a pretty good estimate how much power needs to be available at which part of the day, that information is also constantly updated and used to set the base production of electricity.

You could say that how we produce the power doesn't really matter.Now for your next question about how much they produce... they guess.  Really, they just guess.  It's a well informed guess, though.  They go by how much power was produced at that time yesterday, every day of the week, month, year, etc..

The math can get pretty complicated, as they consider all these things.  But in the end, it's an estimation; a guess.

The fuzz or lining or batting fibers interlock and form these pockets. The blanket starts at room temperature, but when you use it to cover yourself your body heat becomes trapped by these air pockets and then warms them up, and the blanket may begin to feel warm to the touch.Rocks, on the other hand, have relatively few air pockets, if any. They are very dense, and the heat capacity for most rocks is very high, meaning that it takes a lot of energy to change their temperature. The rocks start out at room temperature, just like the blanket. If you were to cover up with them, or perhaps build a house out of the rocks, it would take a lot of energy to heat it up. However, once the rocks got warm, it would also take a lot of energy to cool them off again, so it would stay warm longer than the blankets would after you stopped adding heat through your body heat or maybe a fireplace.Additionally, the reason that rocks feel cooler when you first touch them has to do with relative body heat. Things that are at lower temperatures than your body feel cool, things that are higher feel hot. A room temperature rock will feel cooler than your 98.6 F body.  But, blankets are made of fibers and air pockets so while they also feel cool at first, the friction between your skin and the fibers generates heat quickly and heats up the air pockets, making the blanket feel warm much more quickly than the rock.

In the real world it is a lot more complicated.The greenhouse effects of gases depend on their concentration and the wavelengths that they block.  Methane has a much lower concentration than carbon dioxide and blocks wavelength that overlap with the \u201creal\u201d greenhouse gas ... water vapor.  Therefore, the real world effect of methane is much less than the theoretical one.  Not 28x or 34x but only about 7x.Methane stays in the atmosphere for a much shorter period than carbon dioxide.  Therefore, unlike carbon dioxide it\u2019s effect is not cumulative.  If the cattle population stays the same then there is no more warming effect.  So in any country with a stable or decreasing cattle population all of their methane contributes the equivalent of exactly zero tonnes of carbon dioxide.So a more accurate answer to OPs question is that the words are quite meaningless.As further background, the reason cattle produce methane is that they digest cellulose from plants.  If there were no cattle the plants would just be digested by microbes in the soil, and other animals, all producing methane.  So unless someone is planning to destroy all plant life along with the cattle methane is getting produced anyway.

If this process of crushing and sifting is repeated several times, nearly all of the endosperm is separated from the bran and germ.The endosperm is harder and more brittle than the germ and bran, so it shatters into smaller particles when crushed.Whole wheat flour is just that. The sifting/winnowing step is omitted and the entire kernel is further milled into finished flour with fine particles. There is usually a sifting step at the end to remove large fragments, but this is simply fed back into the mill at the beginning to be further broken down in size.White flour is considered to produce the best quality bread and cakes. Most of the fiber in wheat is contained in the bran and germ. Fiber interferes with the development of gluten in dough, producing a less chewy, elastic bread.Most of the oil is also contained in the bran and germ. This can slowly oxidize, causing the flour to become rancid or stale. Thus, white flour has a longer shelf life.However, most of the vitamins and minerals are contained in the germ and bran. So whole wheat flour is more nutritious. White flour in many countries is required by laws to be fortified with extra vitamins and minerals for this reason.  Whole wheat flour due to it's higher oil content, has more of a characteristic \"wheaty\" flavor, which some people like.Different types of four are classified by their protein content.Cake flour has the the lowest protein content and the highest starch content. Usually about 5-7%It's produced from certain low protein varieties of wheat, often described as \"soft\" referring to the fact that they produce a soft dough. Usually Soft Winter types. The terms \"Pastry flour\" and \"cake flour\" are sometimes used interchangeably, and these flours usually can be.  Cake flour with low protein results in small bubbles on rising and moist texture.Pastry flour is usually defined to have slightly higher protein than cake flour, around 6-9%. This is also usually made with soft winter types.This makes it easy to roll out into sheets, owing to limited stretch and gluten.\"All purpose\" flower tends to be a grab bag. It's usually blended from several different wheat varieties with different protein content or \"hardness.\"  Really, whatever is available to the mill that can produce the protein level they want. This produces a flour with about 10-12% protein. However hard winter wheat is the most common source, at least in the US. The climate in much of the Central and northern US tends to be ideal for winter wheat, which is planted in the fall and harvested early next summer.Despite this, I would not recommend using AP flour for yeast bread. It works reasonably well for baking powder breads like american biscuits/ and UK scones. However it's best to adulterate AP with cornstarch or rice flour in a 2:1 ratio, respectively, for the purpose of pastry and fine cakes.\"Bread flour\" has the highest protein content, more than 13%. It's typically made from hard spring wheat varieties.In some stores you can also buy \"Durum\" aka Semolina flour, which is normally used to make pasta.This is made from a different species of wheat, Triticum durum vs common bread wheat which is Triticum aestivum. It tends to have a higher protein content, however much less is gluten forming proteins. This gives pasta made from it the characteristic chewy texture, but due to the lack of gluten it is easy to form into pasta shapes.Durum wheat also prefers hotter, drier weather, and a warmer, wetter winter, and a longer growing season, so it's grown in lower latitudes such as southern europe, and the middle East."}, {"date": "09/02/20", "score": null, "text": "So are hard spring (bread) and soft winter (cake) wheats still Triticum aestivum?"}]}, {"question": "ELI5: Why does your hand get hot if you stick it in a tub of powdered laundry detergent?", "author_name": "himomimfailing", "date": "23/02/20", "flair": "Chemistry", "answers": [{"date": "23/02/20", "score": 28, "text": "There are (at least) three reasons why this happens:the air spaces between the particles trap the heat from your hand.

Many microbes need oxygen to survive, some don't.Many microbes can't handle too much salt or sugar, which makes them shrivel like slugs in salt.  Sugar may surprise you since it is a food that many microbes eat, but too much of it also causes this osmotic effect of pulling water out of cells and to it.  This is why jam/jelly/honey almost never go bad.Many microbes can't handle acid. They need a neutral or basic pH so we can add acids like ascorbic acid which is just vitamin C.  Or citric acid like when you think of citrus fruit. It's important not to be afraid of big science words on labels. Some processed stuff can be bad, but a lot of it is fine. Don't be afraid of vitamin C.Temperature can also halt microbial growth, but since cans have many lines of defense, you usually don't need to worry about it as long as you store it in a reasonable place, but this is why you refrigerate after opening.There are some other preservatives, but you get the idea. Preservatives get a bad rap but they literally save our society from starving on a daily basis....Fun fact: ascorbic acid (vitamin C) comes from the word scorbitos, meaning scurvy, and a-scorbitos means 'no scurvy' when it was found vitamin C prevents the condition.Scurvy can cause bleeding gums because it is a weakening and lack of new production and repair of collagen -- the body's structural, fiberous protein. Vitamin C is a gene promotor for the genes that make collagen, meaning that collagen binds to the start button that tells your body to make collagen.When collagen is made, it is a long string called pre-pro-collagen. The string is cut and twisted like small strands together to make yarn, which is stronger.  The structure is a triple helix (DNA is double helix) and the bonds that hold the strands to one-another are called hydrogen bonds. Vitamin C also donates the hydrogen to make those bonds.  This is why vitamin C is also the gene promotor.  Your body doesn't want to make collagen if it doesn't have enough vitamin C to finish the job.And the most they tell you about vitamin C is that it is an antioxidant.. don't get me started on that.."}, {"date": "20/02/20", "score": 0, "text": "Lack of oxygen in the can.

This happens because the end results of the reaction are a more preferable state to be in, thermodynamically. Let's take an example:Hydrochloric acid and sodium metal. In its normal state, sodium is just a bunch of sodium atoms all in one place. Hydrochloric acid is made by dissolving the covalent HCl molecule in water, creating a solution with a lot of charged hydrogen and charged Chlorine atoms (a charged molecule is loves to react with things, is probably the most you need to know about that). Normally, hydrogen and chlorine don't really like each other when they're in water together, so they disassociate, instead of remaining as HCl. They also don't like being alone, though, and can only hang out in their gaseous forms when they're stuck to another atom of the same element. However, because of how they share electrons, they can't do this. That's a really complicated thing though that I suspect you don't need to know about.Then, you drop some Sodium into the mix. Charged chlorine loves to stick to sodium, so every chlorine atom in the acid plucks one sodium atom off the sodium piece, forming sodium chloride. This moves some electrons around, and allows the hydrogen to float off as hydrogen gas (hence why this reaction fizzes). Sodium chloride meanwhile is an ionic compound (common table salt, in fact), which dissolves in water and which forms crystals, not metals. So, gradually, the size of the sodium piece gets smaller, because sodium is being ripped off to become sodium chloride, and the acid also becomes less acidic because the molecules that make it acidic are being turned into salts and gasses.The acidic property of acids comes from the fact that hydrogen atoms dissociate from their compounds while dissolved in water. Not all hydrogen-containing compounds do this, but the ones that do are called acids.

Fructose is a lot sweeter than glucose or sucrose, which means less of it is required to create the taste of sweetness. Many artificial sweeteners are fructose-based. Fructose is also less versatile than glucose in terms of what the body can use it for.The sugar in sweets is typically sucrose, as is raw white sugar. Sucrose is broken down into 1 glucose and 1 fructose in your small intestine. The glucose is subsequently stored in the liver, whilst the fructose behaves like fructose. Generally, you need more sucrose to create a flavour of sweetness than you do fructose, however, sucrose is also waaaaay easier to make and also quite a lot easier to work with, which is why it's the go to sugar for things like baking.The sugar in things like potatoes and meat tend to be glucose-based polysaccharides. In potatoes, this is starch. This kind of sugar you probably hear referred to most often as \"carbohydrates\". They're the carbohydrates that don't count as \"of which sugar\" on food labels. These sugars take quite a while for your digestive tract to digest, and are also very easily stored by the liver (the first stop of the blood after the small intestine, where glucose is absorbed), meaning that these large glucose-based polysaccharides are much less of an issue for blood sugar levels than sucrose is. Also, these polysaccharides don't taste sweet, which means they don't activate the brain's dopamine very much, and thus it's much harder to over-eat.Bonus round: Lactose sugars found in milk and other dairy products are even less sweet than glucose, but is pretty much identical to glucose in terms of function since the body rapidly converts it into glucose. However, most humans can't actually digest lactose at all.No sugar is directly worse for your health than any other.

Chemistry works in a weird ways, for example, the same molecule can be either deadly or an effective drug to combat severe desease (enantiomers).Now, to explain why it is still used and how it is safe (kinda) think about table salt and gold production.Table salt (NaCl) is made of sodium (explosive when exposed to oxygen) and chlorine (deadly as pure gas).

It is always harder to attack something that is above you. It requires more effort and energy, and you have a disadvantage in the operation and effectiveness of your weaponry. (This refers more to traditional, pre-20th century combat. Modern weaponry and materiel largely obviate much of this concern.)Your defenses are enhanced by gravity. The enemy has to make an extra effort to reach and attack your position, and their efforts are hampered by gravity. The fort has the opposite advantage: Anything you throw or shoot will be headed downwards, and thus require less effort on your part to reach the attackers.All of these advantages pertain to pre-modern concerns, obviously. Modern technology makes it possible to monitor huge areas from high mobile platforms, to easily and effectively attack from any angle, and also to defend from any angle.

The big guys don't fight each other, instead they lend guns and sniper aid to the smaller guys.One of the things that has happened here is that a code of honor has been defined. And it's been explicitly agreed on. Now we don't want this to just be a gentleman's agreement, the rules include things like no low hits, no shooting at your wife and children if they're unarmed, not using pepper spray in the bar, not using a grenade in fights, etc; so instead all the nations have agreed that if someone breaks it, they're allowed to shoot them, and their allies and such don't need to defend or protect them (they might even participate in the shooting, so heinous is the crime).The thing is, once a fight begins, rules kind of fall out of line. But you're supposed to behave as honorably as possible, and when you don't nations would respond to it. They'll demand that some justice is made to balance the act out. Generally nations will argue they didn't intend to do this, but that some of their soldiers did. So they are tried as individuals. Now the crimes committed are considered specially heinous, war in itself can be seen as a crime done by nations, but these crimes stand out and jump among them. Things like stealing, destruction of property, etc. are simply facts of life in war. But destroying cultural heritage, killing people who are not a threat or are even there to help both sides, etc. are considered heinous and still a prosecutor crime even when war is happening. Hence war crimes. These crimes can go higher and higher, generally when a nation breaks the rules it's seen as a justification for others to shoot it, they may not want to at first due to an all-out shootout happening, but after a while someone will grow desperate and shoot, and the others will have to agree on the honor bound rules, at the least to make it everyone against one, and not an all-out melee."}, {"date": "24/01/20", "score": 0, "text": "This answer is really good.  These treaties were created on the heels of WWII  and Korea.  Meaning:  large conventional forces facing large conventional forces.  The essence of \u201cconventional forces\u201d is that they are uniformed:  each side can spot the combatants and and as a rough tactical guideline those forces more or less avoid human and \u201ccultural heritage\u201d shields.The treaties are utterly inappropriate for modern warfare.  The modern soldier facing conventional forces intentionally uses tactics calculated to frustrate enemies concerned about war-crimes.  For example, placing an anti-air emplacement next to a mosque, housing resupply depots in hospitals and the like in areas they control.  In contested areas, the order of the day will be \u201cinsurgent\u201d warfare\u2014a method in every way designed to use the civilian population as a terrified human shield and form of camouflage.For example, Mexican drug cartels are terrorist organizations by any definition not tortured into a shape meant to exclude them specifically while still keeping ISIS in the Venn diagram.  The most likely reason the US has not declared them as terrorist organizations is the understanding that they would immediately launch a full scale insurgent war in the US.  The US, in turn, is both too morally weak and too constrained by war-crimes treaties to take the actions necessary both in the US and Mexico to put down the cartels permanently.The point of this is that the war-crimes concept needs revision and adaptation to an age where insurgency and terrorism is the norm of conflict and not the exception.  Keeping in mind that the just goal of war for modern democracies is to have BOTH peace AND freedom inside its borders.

sourceMappingURL=IdCard.85bee69f2f559267015c.css.map*/On a piano, that's easy, you just play the black key instead of the white key.  On a stringed instrument, you just change your finger position. For most wind instruments (flutes, clarinets, etc) they have tons of different holes and fingering arrangement possibilities that allow you to change the key.A harmonica, however, only has 10 holes, each of which can only play 2 notes (technically more with lip and tongue movements, but if we're talking about just your standard \"blow out, suck in\" note, then it's 2 notes). Those notes are set so if you start at the left side and go right, blowing out a sucking in, it will play up the scale (Do, Re, Mi etc).  So, for example, if a harmonica is in the key of C, then the notes it will play will always be C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C.Unlike the instruments mentioned above, the harmonica doesn't give you a built in option to play any other notes (outside of more complex mouth manipulation). So, if a song is written in the key of G, and you have a C Major harmonica, you are going to to run into an issue every time you get to an F... the harmonica will play of F, but the song calls for an F#.  So, to properly play the song, you're going to need a harmonica in the key of G.All that being said, the \"common\" harmonica is going to be in C, and you CAN play any note through mouth manipulation, but if you're a serious player, it'd be better to have a harmonica in the key of your song."}, {"date": "29/01/20", "score": null, "text": "Pretty sure in a \"C\" harmonica, the blown notes are C E G C E G C E G C, one note for each hole. Play three notes together, you get a C chord (C E G). The notes C E and G are one \"tone\" apart from eachother. These harmonicas are called Diatonic harmonicas. And yes, because this only plays notes in the key of C, you need harmonicas in other keys to accommodate different keys.Chromatic harmonicas play every single note."}, {"date": "29/01/20", "score": null, "text": "A standard diatonic harmonica only plays some of the notes in the scale.  A G major harmonical will only play the notes G, A, B, C, D, and F#, which will be the most commonly used notes in any piece in the key of G major.  If the song uses other notes, as anything not in G major is likely to (and even some in G major will), you cannot play it on a harmonica without modifications.Chromatic harmonicas have a device, usually a button or a slide, that shifts all the notes up or down one semitone.  This allows them to play any note, but some keys are going to be a lot easier than others.  Also, since all the holes change in lockstep, it is not possible to play chords that require notes from both configurations."}, {"date": "30/01/20", "score": null, "text": "A harmonica is so called because it harmonizes with itself. A good chunk of the time, you are playing two or more notes at once, so those notes better sound good together. The easiest way to ensure this is to build the harmonica so that it instead of producing all possible notes in a certain range, it can only produce notes that all belong to the same scale: C major, G major, etc. This way, you won't produce two notes that clash with each other (at least, not too much), simply because you can't.Interestingly, there is also an instrument called a melodica that produces sound in the same way a harmonica does, so it sounds similar. The difference is that a melodica requires you to press keys on a small keyboard. This allows you to more easily play single notes, and thus more easily play melodies. Hence, \"melodica\"."}, {"date": "30/01/20", "score": null, "text": "To some degree yes, you would either need several harmonicas in various keys or a chromatic harmonica. The reason I say \"to some degree\" is that there are a few players who can play chromatically on any diatonic harmonica without the audience really being able to tell the difference. I don't know why more players don't work out the technique and actually study their instrument... but whatever.Years ago I went to a clinic with Lee Oskar and Jay Maybin. Lee brought a harmonica in each key, and Jay brought a single harmonica in D. When they went to play something Lee would call out a tune in a key like Ab major, grab his Ab harmonica and then look to Jay. Jay would just shrug and make some comment like \"meh, Ab's a fine key\". You couldn't tell that Jay was using a D harmonica the whole evening."}, {"date": "29/01/20", "score": null, "text": "Nah, they\u2019re made in a given key so you can pretend you actually know how to play a harmonica."}, {"date": "30/01/20", "score": 0, "text": "You can actually buy a chromatic harmonica that solves that problem for you.

Essentially, the FDA does not want people overlooking actual medical treatment by taking supplements to treat or cure a disease.In the FDA\u2019s eyes, any substance intended to diagnose, treat or cure a disease falls under the legal term of a \u201cdrug\u201d.There is a very lengthy process for getting approval of a new drug to treat a disease, as any potential substance must undergo and pass clinical trials.  The FDA evaluates all drugs based on the outcome of the trials where things like efficacy, dosage and safety are all heavily scrutinized. To put it simply, anything that is marketed as a supplement in the US has either not been submitted for trial, has not passed a trial, will not pass a trial or otherwise has not been subjected to the lengthy (and expensive!!) process.But, you know, people may still want to take echinacea for a cold or valerian root for sleep so as long as the substance isn\u2019t explicitly dangerous, the FDA is fine with that. So supplements end up sitting in a weird regulatory space where the enforcement ends up being pretty hands-off unless you make an unsubstantiated claim (i.e. its a new \u201cdrug\u201d in the eyes of the FDA) of poison somebody.

In history, wealth was a prerequisite even for basic literacy in many countries. One cannot read books of learning if one cannot read,- Free time is key. A serf working the fields is a serf that isn't sitting at home with a prism and a light source trying to map the visible light spectrum. Being free from needing to labour for your livelihood is a key definition of wealth,- Wealth itself allows access to expensive materials and equipment, especially pioneering equipment. An average peasant from Pisa couldn't afford a telescope in the early 17th Century, but Galileo Galilei could. Hence why he was the one who bought one, and with his free leisure time, turned it to the stars,However, I will also add two factors that undermine these things. The first is that, by definition of literacy being concentrated among wealthier classes, the voices of the past are concentrated there as well. This is an endemic problem we must always be aware of in studying history, as the wealthy often have good cause to claim progress as being part of their stewardship.As an example, we know that the Great Pyramid of Giza was built for Pharoah Khufu[1] from archaeological expeditions into its interior. We also know of its architect, Heimenu,[1] from his tomb nearby which details his standing as Grand Vizier and Architect. However, we have no knowledge on anyone below these two figures. Did Heimenu truly design the whole thing himself? Ian Shaw notes in The Ancient History of Egypt that the structure shows signs that it was changed midway, hence why the burial chamber is not situated below ground level as in the other pyramids.[1] We can't say with any certainty whether full credit lies with Heimenu, or if instead, they had a cohort of advisers and architects who did much of the work of designing. To say nothing of the legions who physically built the monument.The second factor is that there are instances of average peasantry, or at least those of lower classes, contributing to advancements when given the means to learn and write. For example, during the Tokugawa Era many Buddhist temples were established across the Japanese islands. These temples operated as schools for the local people, teaching reading and writing among other things.[2] This ability to share information resulted in a series of great changes across Japan, as farmers could share animal husbandry techniques, irrigation advice, and other useful agricultural knowledge. This resulted in a steady growth in productivity that enabled the Japanese population to grow continually without significant famine.[2] And we don't know a single one of the names responsible.[1] The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt, I. Shaw 1961 p88-89[2] A Modern History of Japan: From Tokugawa Times to the Present Day, A. Gordon, 1952"}]}, {"question": "ELI5: What is the purpose of the blue tape at the top of your windshield after it's been replaced and why does it need to be there for 24 hours?", "author_name": "D-man-Realty", "date": "23/02/20", "flair": "Other", "answers": [{"date": "21/02/20", "score": 19, "text": "It keeps the windshield in place, while the adhesive that actually holds it to the car has time to seal and mold properly so that there is no separation"}, {"date": "21/02/20", "score": 4, "text": "The places i've changed my windscreen at uses induction heaters or something to cure the adhesive.

Group bonding that transcends physical presence.As such, it helps people also be more secure.  People who don't fit in are noticed really quickly.

On top of feeding off the crowd etc."}, {"date": "25/12/19", "score": 12, "text": "Wack!! I mix music so I've always respected DJs but having to do it live... Even more mad respect.

Hip hop was invented when DJs like Grandmaster Flash developed techniques to match the beats of 2 songs, extend a breakdown using 2 copies of a record, rhythmic scratching etc. Those DJs were all about developing cool techniques to make a bit of a collage with their sets. Grandmaster Flash's Adventures on the Wheel of Steel was essentially a single-length version of one of these sets. Keep in mind that at this point, the records these DJs played hadn't been produced especially for DJs. This is in contrast to dance music, which is a different culture and different technique. Dance music sets were (and still are) about long, flowing sets, and playing the hottest new tracks. Dance music producers are made or broken by DJs, so they started to kind of standardise their tracks. Same tempo, same arrangement, same intro, same outro. This enabled DJs to very easily transition between tracks and make 6 hour sets. This is why dance music is split up into a thousand sub genres - they're essentially DJ templates. So no, dance music DJs don't do a lot. It's more about knowing the hottest new tracks, and picking the right tracks at the right times in your set. Beat matching 8 bars of music that already have the same beat and tempo is easy. Keeping a party going with 6 hours of music isn't."}, {"date": "25/12/19", "score": 4, "text": "If I remember correctly, he used a crayon to mark the records where the beat started on each record so he could swap and start back over on the other side."}, {"date": "25/12/19", "score": 16, "text": "There\u2019s kind of 2 types:1: some DJs will pick the tracks as they go depending on a number of factors, including their read of the crowd. (Some tracks may be their own if they produce music as well, but often it\u2019s other artists tracks). They\u2019ll mix the tracks together as seamlessly as possible and maybe add in some tweaks here and there. This includes looping, key and beat matching and all that. Some DJs use vinyl, in which case the above are impossible (in the case of looping) or very difficult (key and beat matching)@keyframes

Pots, pans, plates, glass, etc. Plastics are iffy - I, for one, have melted my fair share. Delicate things get damaged - wood, wood spoons, wood handles, wood cutting boards, anything wood glue that holds cutting boards and things together, and your knife edge.Just a quick bit about wood - you can buy a bag of wood spoons for $10, and stick them in the dish washer, who cares? But wood you can't cheaply and easily replace - cutting boards, utensil handles, rolling pins, DO NOT dish wash them. What you want to do is hand wash those things and then wipe them down with butcher block oil. Water is bad for wood, soapy water doubly so. There are oils in the wood that give it its shine and protects it, and you're stripping it away. That's why brown and blonde woods go gray, shrink, twist, and crack. Hot, soapy water is terrible for wood glues, too, and will take your cutting boards apart. Any wood finish on a bowl or nice spoon will dissolve, too.If you have a stainless steel knife with a resin handle, it's basically fine. Your flatware is all a cheap grade of stainless that can withstand the same environment. The biggest problem is that knife edge. Being battered around by, or battered by not only the water, but what's in the water, can dull the blade.We're not talking butter knives, maybe steak knives, but definitely kitchen knives.

An edge should look dull.You can sharpen at home, and there are a number of emery board gadgets to help you upkeep your edge, you can even stone your edge yourself; but it takes practice, time, and patience. I recommend having your knives sharpened on whatever schedule makes sense for you, depending on how much you use them - every 6 months if you don't know any better.

Then in our stomach, it gets churned with acid, and finally it goes into our intestines which further digest fats and protein, and our large intestine absorbs what water it can.And whatever we can't absorb, we poop out! So it's not a 1-to-1 relationship between the mass of the food we eat, and how much weight we gain.The caloric value of a food item is how much of it our body can process and absorb as usable energy. It is related to how much food we eat, but much more important is what the food is made out of.As a general rule, carbohydrates and protein are worth roughly 4 calories per gram, while fat clocks in at 9 calories per gram.Take water, for example. Even if we drank 2kg of water a day (roughly 2l), we wouldn't put on weight in the long run- because water doesn't have any caloric value.

Things like sugars (glucose for example) naturally hold a lot of energy because plants produce glucose as a mechanism to store the energy they make.The reason calories in particular are so important for weight loss or gain is that the body requires energy to build and maintain cells and tissues.If you reduce your calorie intake, your body suddenly loses the ability to provide energy to all of its cells. Fat cells are stores of this energy, so it will begin by using these up.Let's say I want to gain 10 lbs of muscle. Even if I get a great work out in 3 times a week, I won't build any muscle if I'm not taking in enough energy for my body to sustain that extra mass.Think about eating spoonfuls of peanut butter. Peanut butter contains a lot of sugars and fats, so it is very calorie dense. Something like the lettuce in a salad on the other hand, is mostly composed of water, which has 0 calories.Different foods have different chemical compositions, and so vary greatly when it comes to things like calories, macros, and micronutrients.People often in fact suggest using food mass as a way to trick your body into gaining or losing weight. Your hunger actually does not depend on calorie consumption, it depends much more on how full your stomach is.Instead of eating less food to lose weight, you should eat a similar amount of food that is less calorically dense so that you're consuming fewer calories, but feeling no more hungry than before.Similarly, body builders suggest eating food that is more calorically dense, and chewing very well so that you can fit more calories in the same amount of space in your stomach."}]}, {"question": "ELI5: Why are perfectly cut screams so funny to us?

This is also why you often see shortened shotguns with no stocks, either.Shortening the barrel has the effect of reducing the shot velocity slightly, and widening the spread of the shot. These are further tradeoffs in favor of concealability and the ability to get close to your target before firing."}, {"date": "10/02/20", "score": 12, "text": "\"Sawed off shotgun\" sounds more intimidating and badass than they actually are.  As others have pointed out, in terms of ballistic effectiveness a shorter barrel actually means less projectile velocity and thus less effectiveness on target, plus if you actually \"sawed off\" the barrel you can expect really crappy pellet groupings.  The main, and in my 30 years of experience handling guns and having worked in the industry I'm willing to say the only real, advantages of a short barreled shotgun are concealabilty and maneuverability in close quarters.  They're a good weapon for an ambush or a hitman, they're a poor weapon for anything resembling an actual gunfight."}, {"date": "10/02/20", "score": 2, "text": "Also to address the \"changes in lethality with its shortening\": projectile effectiveness relies on several factors, but the big three are mass, velocity, and construction.  Construction refers to solid/non-expanding projectile, hollow-point/soft-point/expanding projectile, flat or round nose, etc and I'm not going to go into that here because that's gonna be a lot of information.The most commonly accepted standard of cartridge/bullet power pre-impact  is simply \"energy\", which is measure in \"foot-pounds\" and is calculated using the velocity and mass of the bullet.  It's a pretty reliable standard but breaks down at extremes; very large but slow bullets are far more effective than their energy would suggest, and the inverse is true about very light but fast bullets.  Assuming equal bullet mass and type of construction, a faster bullet will be more powerful.  Longer barrels nearly always result in more velocity (while there are examples of, say, 2\" barrels giving higher numbers than 3\" barrels, you'll notice those are always treated as anomalies because they are.)  So when you shorten the barrel, you lower the velocity and therefore the energy of the projectile.

Is that materialist or not? It depends on what you think it is. Are emergent phenomena materialist? One could argue about it. Are ghosts really supernatural, or could there possibly materialist explanations? What about ESP? Most scientists would say, obviously these are supernatural, aka, non-materialist. Some might argue, no no, I've got a materialist explanation.A lot of the history of science (which is what I study and teach) is involved with people arguing over which hypothetical \"entities\" we admit into the world of \"nature\" (and the \"material\") and which we exclude. Electrons and bacteria, check. Phlogiston and the aether, nope. One way to think about what \"what is science?\" is that science is a tool to try and figure out which of these entities are actually part of our world, and how they work.Today, in the scientific study of the natural world, materialism is pretty obvious and boring unless you are committed to some non-materialist aspects of life, or someone is committed to declaring some things as non-materialist that others think are materialist (so materialist Soviet philosophers in the 1930s objected that Einstein's relativity involved non-materialist explanations for gravity; physicists disagreed there was anything in the math that was incompatible with materialism). The Creationists are absolutely correct in saying that modern natural science is exclusively materialist; it is one of its distinguishing and powerful features (even, again, if that doesn't tell you, by itself, what ends up being included in that \"materialism\").Outside of scientific contexts, materialism is not what most people seem to believe.

Groundwater is often depleted much, much faster than it's replenished.You see the problem by now, I guess.Also, pumping water for use lowers the level of (closer to surface) ground water, making it harder or even impossible for plants (like deep-rooting trees) to reach it.Finally, pumping, treating and possibly heating water costs energy."}, {"date": "03/02/20", "score": null, "text": "I think the issue is processed water that is used outside the \"natural\" water cycle in places it would not ordinarily be, and then put into nature where it would not ordinarily go."}, {"date": "03/02/20", "score": null, "text": "True, it's not the water itself that's the concern.

There is a total of 1000 liters of water in this dome at any given time. Any water that I use, whether it is to cook food, wash clothes, drink, or water my crops, will still be part of the cycle. However, while I'm using a given liter of water, my fellow tribespeople cannot use that same liter. If it's in my cooking pot, it cannot also water my neighbor's plants. Once I'm done with it, I may give it to my neighbor. Or, I may discard it and it will find its way back to the lake from which we both get our water, and then he can use it.So, while no water ever gets used up (not permanently anyway), it's still important how much water is in use at any given time. If our tribe's water use gets out of hand, our demand might go beyond the 1000 liters that are in our dome. Now maybe I want to drink some water, but I can't, because every liter of water is being used elsewhere. The fact that this water will eventually be freed up again is no good to me right now.Also, even if we only use, say, 800 liters of water at any given time, the question is where the remaining water hangs out. If it's in the lake, that's fine because we can go there and collect it. But if it's in the air, in clouds or water vapor, then we need to wait for it to rain. If it's in the ground, we also may not be able to get to it. So, even if there is enough water under our dome in total, there may not be enough that's actually available at any given time.One important way in practice that water in the water cycle becomes unavailable is when it ends up in the ocean. While it is in there, we have practically no access to it, unless we expend a lot of energy to remove the salt from the water that we want to use. So in practice, we have to wait for the salt water to evaporate and rain down as fresh water again.So yeah, in short, it's all about how much water is available at any given time. The fact that water is in a closed cycle is no good to me if I need to wait too long for water to become available again, or other people always get to it before I can."}]}, {"question": "ELI5: How does therapy actually work, how do you find a good one, and what's the difference between counseling/therapy/psychiatrists/psychologists/etc.?", "author_name": "AarontheGeek", "date": "23/02/20", "flair": "Other", "answers": [{"date": "26/09/19", "score": 936, "text": "I'm going to vastly oversimplify how it works, but:Me: shows up to therapy as a simmering cauldron of low self-esteem and negative self-talkTherapist: gets me to talk about these thingsTherapist: helps me explore where these things probably came from (i.e., formative years with fucked-up parents)Therapist: validates that things were severely fucked-up; provides thoughts on how it could have been handled better (if you really trust and respect your shrink, this voice will eventually replace the shitty-parent voice in your head)Me: continues week-by-week to report new stimulus from my life and how I am handling these thingsTherapist: understands current course of action based on deep understanding of my past, continues to validate current feelings, but also suggests different ways to handle and interpret these things going forwardMe: very slowly learns a different way of thinking about life and about myself, and of handling the things the world throws at meI really believe in therapy as a long-term iterative process.

The issue with this approach is that the sensor can only receive so much light at once, and obviously a small sensor receives less light than a big one.If a small sensor like you'd see in a phone has loads of pixels, then each individual pixel gets a smaller share of the total light for the sensor.Contrast that to a DSLR, with a sensor of 24/35mm, that has only 24MP for example. The sensor itself is much bigger, and the light is being shared by fewer pixels.

In practical terms, all other things being equal, low light shots on a small sensor will be more noisy. One way some phones try to fix this is by taking multiple images (more than one camera or a bunch of images in series) and using comparison between images to eliminate noise. This works because noise is random and signal is not. Such image stacking is how backyard astronomy is getting really amazing these days.depth of field: large sensor cameras often have lenses that support shooting at reasonable distances with a shallow depth of field. That blurring is very useful when composition does not make your subject 'pop'. There are a number of software solutions to this one...but often natural depth of field just looks better. This is the whole insanity about bokeh.character: when shooting with large sensor cameras, particularly with vintage optics, it is possible to get different character.

sourceMappingURL=IdCard.85bee69f2f559267015c.css.map*/In theory, you could retrofit a coal plant to burn trash instead, in practice the design of the boiler furnace tends to be completely different. The biggest difficulty lies in processing the trash to burn effectively, and in controlling the combustion to ensure efficient mixing of fuel with air.The trash needs to be, as much as possible, sorted, and metallic materials removed such as screws,wires, circuit boards, small appliances. This kind of sorting equipment adds to costs, time, monitoring labor, and complexity. The trash then needs to be shredded. This is a technically more challenging process than crushing coal.Unlike coal or wood,  plastics melt and gain a molasses-like consistency as they burn. This can cause the fuel to clump into a sticky solid mass,  stick to walls, and possibly block bottom ventilation holes. This can slow the burn process, reducing power output. Note that in order to produce the most power output you want to burn the fuel a quicky as possible.Also, not all trash materials are flammable, so you end up with a higher proportion of ash and metallic waste. Many plastic consumer items contain embedded glass fibers to strengthen them, for example. These may melt slightly but they don't burn.Some mechanism or special feature needs to be added to keep the burn chamber cleaned and to remove ash and unburned plastic char.Trash often contains PVC type plastics which produce corrosive hydrogen chloride gas when burned. This can corrode the boiler tubes and exhaust handling equipment. It needs to be scrubbed from the exhaust gas.Biggest reason is that coal fired power plants are simply not cost effective to run in most areas, as they have significant maintainance costs for the boiler. At present, natural gas burning direct gas turbines are significantly more cost effective, and tend to be more efficient.So a trash burning plant would fare no better than a coal plant without being subsidized by local governments. Nobody wants to do this because why not just pay a cheaper price for power from a natural gas plant?"}, {"date": "24/01/20", "score": 3, "text": "Great answer with lots of detail. Thanks.The only thing I I'd argue with is your last sentence.  Some countries do have very high landfill dumping costs (direct costs plus taxation) so even without government subsidies, the cost can get closer to coal and gas for energy production.

This means that they were probably pretty involved in composing them, so they have a better idea of how they go. A single band also has a pretty small catalog of music compared to the thousands of compositions an orchestra might potentially play. Relatedly, orchestras strive to perfectly recreate the piece because someone else composed it. If they decided to change Beethoven's 5th on the fly, is it really still Beethoven's 5th?The second difference is that orchestras typically require more precision and coordination than a smaller band. If two trumpets play the correct part and one messes up, you're going to hear it. If the bassist in a rock band hits a wrong note, there's less to compare the mistake to. Popular genres of music also typically involve a lot more fluidity and improvisation.

Typically, an orchestra is funded by donors, ticket sales wouldn\u2019t fully cover the conductor, soloist, and musicians pay.

I think when you sing a song in a different language it appears to line up because you're purposely singing in rhythm with the music, but in reality the translated words aren't spoken on the exact same note/syllable as the original, but it still sounds good because you're still singing in rhythm to the song. But to further reinforce my point, try looking up a rap song in a different language, and turn in the english subtitles, you'll find yourself saying \"wow these guys suck\". I say rap in specific because unlike melodic music that is sang (or screamed \ud83d\ude09) rap is focused primarily on delivery, flow and rhyming, and the lines are written in form of bars (like poetry) now obviously foreign words dont still rhyme after being translated because thatd be freaky af, but you'll notice that the words dont line up with the music anymore because each line is meant to fit in a specific spot on the beat (for delivery/punchlines).

Clearly, I've only skimmed the surface of how complex simulating a single tree is. The further you dig into simulating just one tree, and it's interconnected relationship to everything else in the simulation, you will discover that the Occam's Razor solution is to simulate nothing. Therefore, we are real, because it's more energy efficient to be real, than simulated.You can't store more information in the state of an electron than would be required to describe the state of an electron. You need at least one electron's worth of matter in your computer for every electron that exists within the simulation. A simulation of the surface of a planet that's detailed down to the subatomic level would require a computer that's at least as large as the surface of the planet it's simulating. And this is where the math part of the entire debate, proves that the simulation can't exist. For practical reason, a simulation of the atomic structures would have to be much larger than the simulation itself.The civilization living in that simulation wouldn't be capable of building a simulation the same size as the one they're living in, since there wouldn't be enough atoms in their simulated universe to build a computer capable of achieving it. This means that the endless recursion of simulations-within simulations that people assume would be happening when the say it's probable that we're living in a simulation is impossible. The only way simulation theory works, is if you turn it into a philosophical debate, and throw out everything about how matter works.Even if you're simulated world doesn't exist until it's observed, the problem is, that once it's observed, it's simulated down to the atomic level. A visible Earth surface, just one atom thin, would take 1037 atoms to simulate.

One explanation might be that the human race ceases to exist before we have time to invent ancestor simulation level technology, which would point towards a rapidly approaching nuclear or plague or other cosmic catastrophe.If you agree with (2), then you have a pretty pessimistic outlook on the future, with some kind of fascist government or fanatical religion exerting absolute control forever on how technology is used by everyone. Again, mass extinction might explain this.So, how do we get to (3)? The argument goes that if we have the technology to simulate ancestral environments (i.e. 1 isn't true) and there is no religious or political obstacle to running such simulations (i.e. 2 isn't true), then such simulations will be run multiple times over the course of future history (that's just the kind of curious monkey species we are). For any point in history then, there will be one 'real' set of people and events, and some large number of simulated copies of those people and events, due to uncounted generations of future historians running simulations (perhaps a class of students doing their homework on early 21st century users of reddit).If you now consider yourself as a random sample from all possible examples of you, both the real and the simulated, then you are more likely to be one of the many simulated versions than the one 'real' version, just as if you had one red ball and 99 blue balls in a bag, you would rationally predict that if you reached in and pulled one out, it would have a 99% chance of being blue, not red.So either you are a pessimist about tech, or a pessimist about society and freedom, or you are unavoidably forced to conclude that the odds are that you are a simulation run by a future historian.Following on from this, you might want to take some precautions against that historian shutting down the simulation you live in. You've got to keep them interested, either by being the focus of historic events yourself, or just from hanging around close to historic events that they'll focus on.

Three things govern exposure: aperture, shutter speed, and ISO.Aperture is the opening of the lens, how \u201cwide open\u201d the iris blades of a lens\u2019 optical element are. The larger and wider the opening, the greater a frequency of light can be let in (this is measured in f-number or f-stops).The smaller the opening, the sharper the image, because focal points are crisper, but the less light is let into the image sensor. An f-stop close to 1/1, let\u2019s says f1/1.8 is very wide open, and so produces a lot of light. And f-stop of 1/8 is proportionally much smaller, and therefore produces less light. These fractions are usually expressed without the 1/ to avoid redundancy. So f1.8, f2.8, f8.

Anything faster, like S1/1000 will have much sharper movement and less blur, because images are being captured so precisely in such a quick snippet of time.For longer, slower shutter speeds in digital sensor, you WILL get some salt-and-pepper noise from photodiode leakage currents, but this is not the \u201cvideo noise\u201d with purple and green specs that you see in photos in low light.Shutter held open for a longer time, let\u2019s say 2 seconds total, will produce BRIGHTER images \u2014 because the image sensor of a camera received more light over that longer time \u2014 but the blur will make things almost indiscernable.Lastly, there is ISO or grain. ISO in the film days was the amount of granulated silver halide in celluloid. The more silver film had, the more light the image could receive, but the grainier the image.In digital days, ISO relates to gain, or how artificially\u201cboosted\u201d the sensitivity of an image sensor is. With a moderately wide aperture, moderate shutter and \u201cregular\u201d ISO you see a pleasing image. But in low light, to keep that same aperture and shutter, a camera needs to boost the ISO, or the image sensor signal, to accommodate more light.@keyframes

sourceMappingURL=IdCard.85bee69f2f559267015c.css.map*/Essentially, the camera isn\u2019t receiving more light through the width of the lens or the amount of time the shutter gives it, so it has to compensate.You see noise because the camera is taking what it guesses the color values for each pixel are, and brightening it based on that approximation. Because there isn\u2019t enough light to exposure properly, the camera manifests a noisy image with the wrong color values added to different pixels at different times. This produces video noise.Edit:You asked about the human eye, too. This one\u2019s easy. The human eye uses two receptors, called rods and cones, to work together in producing images in your brain.Cones work to produce color vision, rods work to produce night vision but cannot differentiate color. You have 125 million photo receptors in your eyes, and 120 million are rods. This is because cones are very good at seeing color, and use near perfect light situations for their 5 million receptors to work. Behind the scenes, the rods are the most sensitive to light, and so they do most of the work of producing an image in your brain.In low light, your cones can hardly function, they struggle. So your brain uses the rods to produce let\u2019s say a \u201cblack and white\u201d image that is based on shape, and the cones (just like a camera\u2019s processor with limited light, boosting ISO) do their best to send information to your brain to assign color values. This is why you can make out shapes easily in low light, but not color.It\u2019s also why you perceive a \u201cnoisy\u201d image, because your brain is trying to produce a colorful image without enough photo sensitivity from the cones that send those values."}, {"date": "24/01/20", "score": 2, "text": "More like r/explainlikeim50"}, {"date": "24/01/20", "score": 2, "text": "Using your audio analogy, amplifying the input signal would equivalent to ISO on a camera, not shutter speed.

Your energy is supposed to be restored (depending on how long you slept at last)", "author_name": "SirRoderic", "date": "23/02/20", "flair": "Other", "answers": [{"date": "02/02/20", "score": 14, "text": "A few factors: When you are asleep, your brain goes through 90 minute cycles. You gradually fall farther and farther into \"deep\", or slow-wave sleep, until you hit REM sleep, dream a bit, and gradually leave slow-wave sleep into a position just below wakefulness, then you start again slowly going into deep sleep...When you first fall asleep, you will fall much further into deep-sleep in your cycle, and as you near the end of sleep, the slow-wave portion of your cycle will be much more active. (Here's a figure: https://www.howsleepworks.com/images/hypnogram.jpg )If you are woken up during slow-wave sleep, especially when you have not slept in a while, it is extremely jarring because you are essentially trying to ramp up your brain activity from low-to-high like starting a car.Why would you be tired if you had slept all night? This is probably due to the hormones released while you're sleeping. There's a delicate balance of hormones that guide you though you sleep. (For example, GABA might increase and puuuull you into slow-wave, then ACh might increase and puuuull you out of it) These hormones help you stay asleep. Unfortunately, they don't click on and off like a light-switch and take some time to fade when waking up. This can leave you a little groggy.Also probably related: You tend to go through a final faze of REM before waking up. REM is, hands-down, the coolest part of sleep. You will literally die if you are deprived of REM. REM stands for Rapid-Eye-Movement, because your eyes move around when you're dreaming! When you're dreaming, your brain will light up in all sorts of areas of your brain that act out things! When you are in REM, your brain is LITERALLY DOING everything you are doing in your dreams, and your body release chemicals that paralyze you from the neck-down and stop you from getting up and running around! (People with strange sleep problems, it comes from a deficiency in this!) Sometimes people will wake up with sleep paralysis, where they wake up and are conscience, but can't move their body yet because this paralysis hasn't worn off yet. It's pretty scary, but not dangerous. Anyway, since you're going from this paralysis state into wakefulness, it takes your body a little while to adjust.

That means that there are 12 equally-spaced notes to each octave.The reason this works so well is that humans find simple ratios between 2 notes as more pleasing and consonant if their frequencies are related by simple ratios.  For example, an A at 440hz and an E at 660hz give a 3:2 ratio, which we perceive as a perfect fifth. 12-TET happens to give us really good approximations for these ratios, such as 4:3, 5:4, 6:5, and these intervals are what Western music is rooted in.But you don't need to pick 12! Why not 19? Or 22? 24? These equal temperament systems also have good approximations for simple ratios.   But you also get tons of new, foreign ratios that 12-TET can't do.Does it sound bad? Well, go you YouTube and have a listen! They will sound consonant but very alien.  Whether you like that feel is a matter of personal opinion.Tldr - Yes, there are infinite notes between the 12 we use.  They can sound good if you divide the octave with consonance in mind.Edit: At least 1 form of Western music uses one of these in-between notes! Barbershop singing.

This is most common in a cappella singing, because you aren't needing to tune to a 12-TET instrument.  You can also find it on non-guitar stringed instruments.

Many farmers only get revenue at one point in the year, but they have expenses all year long.  They just are really good at budgeting and not over spending just because there's cash in the bank does not mean they can afford something.Here's an example.  It's common for cattle ranchers to sell their entire herd in the fall.  They buy all their cattle in the spring, they feed them and fatten them up over the summer and they sell the whole bunch in the fall.  While not all ranches work this way, many of the smaller ones do.So they might spend $1,500 a head for a skinny young cow in the spring.  At the end of the season they receive $2,250 a head for those same cows.So this farmer has 200 head that he raises each year.  In the spring he spends (1,500*200) $300,000 to buy his cows.  Through the summer he has some expenses such as gas for the trucks, hay to feed the cows when the grass in the field is not enough, vet fees if an animal gets sick and a whole bunch of other expenses.  In the end he spends another $75,000 just raising the cows.In the fall he sells the cows for (2250*200)=$450,000.  This is enough to cover his expenses of purchasing the cattle along with the costs to raise them.  He's made $75,000 in profit.  Now he needs to spread that money all through the whole year for his family to pay expenses like their own food or other costs of living.  The farmer gets all of his entire year's worth of pay in a single day in October.Not all farms work this way, but many do.  Many that grow crops don't have the same up front costs but they have a lot more costs in things like equipment and fertilizer.But the last thing to consider is risk.  If you don't quite make your cows fat enough, or if the worldwide price of beef were to go down the farmer might not get the same price for the cows that he was counting on.  That can mean that he can't repay the loan he took to purchase the cattle in the first place or the loan he took to pay for his land.  A small chance in the price of beef or in the weight of the cattle at the end of the year can make or break a farm for the entire year and in that case they are just fucked unless there's some government program to help out."}]}, {"question": "ELI5: what is \u201ctheory\u201d", "author_name": "whaaatofficial", "date": "23/02/20", "flair": "Other", "answers": [{"date": "20/02/20", "score": 3, "text": "Well, in this case, theory is the opposite of practice.

When I taught introductory physics, we used to do an experiment with students where we took equal temperature ice cubes and put one on a metal slab and one on a block of wood. the ice melted on the metal much faster than the one on the wood despite both being at room temperature because metallic objects conduct heat easier than wood, and this is consequently why it feels cooler to touch than wood.

This means that the information is pieced together from multiple different sources, where nobody has followed the effects of consumption over a full lifetime.The safety tests conducted by regulators, such as the FDA, conduct the tests based on consumption of small amounts. This is to simulate what can be considered a \"health diet\". This means that a sweetener may be totally safe if you drink 1 diet soda in a given time frame, but they haven't even bothered to test what happens if you drink 10 of those diet sodas in the same amount of time. This is to say that the \"healthy diet\" the regulators are assuming is not necessarily the real world diet people are following.The studies conclude that they find no positive link between cancer and sweeteners. This is not the same as saying that it positively does NOT cause cancer, for the very reasons outlined above - the sweeteners have not been tested in every sense.Now you may think say that it is just a conspiracy that the FDA and EU etc. would tell you something is safe and it is not. However, it is only in recent history that both drinking and smoking were actively encouraged as part of a healthy lifestyle to achieve the goals of government and business.The other thing to consider when choosing sweeteners over sugar are the studies that show positive links between consuming sweeteners and overeating. There are two paths of thought on this one:A person knows that they are consuming less calories in a diet soda rather than with sugar. They think that this can balance out that extra bit of food they eat, and end up underestimating how much more they eat.The human body is programmed to begin the process of consuming sugar as soon as your tongue tastes something sweet.

If you were to take the frequency of a certain pitch and double it, the resulting pitch would be exactly one octave higher. Our brains are very happy when perceiving this 2:1 ratio in sound. In fact, it sounds so harmonious to us that untrained listeners often cannot perceive that two discreet notes are being sounded. Other intervals that our brains like are the 3:2 ratio (a fifth) and the 4:3 ratio (a fourth). Western music is based almost completely around these three intervals.This brings us to half and whole steps. It's a little bit complicated to explain without a visual aid, but using the intervals of a fifth and fourth on top of one another results in the octave being divided up into 12 equal half steps. This is the smallest interval that Western music typically uses. It is absolutely possible (and completely normal in other musical systems) to divide into even smaller intervals like quarter steps.

This comes from incandescence, which is the property that things emit EM energy in a distribution of wavelengths that depend on its temperature. When things get hot enough, the amount and distribution of this energy starts moving into visible light. Basically, hot things glow. At around 1000-1500k things begin to glow visibly red. As temperature goes up, that glow brightens and moves more toward orange, then yellow, and eventually blue. Extremely hot things emit light primarily in UV and X-Ray wavelengths but still plenty of visible light, mostly in blue so that's what we see.When exposing a digital photograph, you typically have to set a white balance setting, which involves color temperature. You're telling the camera what temperature of incandescent light source to consider \"white light\". For example, if the scene is lit by standard incandescent light bulbs, we're talking around 3000K. But if it's direct sunlight, that's more like 6000K. Sometimes the light source isn't a natural incandescent source. On a cloudy day, the light takes on more of a bluish hue and simulates a color temperature closer to 8000K. Fluorescent bulbs throw everything off because their spectra aren't smooth and often throw of more green hues, but that's a different problem.If you set your camera to a high color temperature, say 8000K for a scene lit by incandescent bulbs, everything will take on a reddish-orange hue, because the camera is treating a more blue-oriented light as \"white\" and everything is lit by something that's more orange-red. So, this image is \"too warm\" -- the color temperature setting is too high for the scene.Conversely, if you set the camera to expose for incandescent lighting like 3000K but you're out shooting in sunlight or a cloudy day, it's expecting the \"white\" light level to be more orange-focused but instead there's a lot more blue, and so everything in the picture will take on a bluish hue.

Or a car going 100 running into something that instantly slows it down to 50.So two identical cars going 50 mph at each other will have the same impact on each other and will stop dead.  Each each suffers the exact same force as if they had hit an immovable wall.For extra fun, consider this -we've only been dealing with identical cars or super walls.  a massive truck can be going 25 and a small car going 50 that hits it head on might be thrown backwards - the truck might just be slowed down and not stop.

Momentum is mass*velocity. So something with 2x the mass but 1/2 the velocity will have the same momentum as something with 1x mass and 1x velocity. In regards to your comment. If the truck weighs 10x the car with velocity 1/2x the car, then the truck has 5x the momentum. This is enough to overcome the direction the car is moving and force it to go backwards. To find out how fast, you simply calculated the net momentum before the impact, then divide that by the truck and cars mass combined."}]}, {"question": "ELI5: Why did cyan and magenta replace blue and red as the standard primaries in color pigments?

Technology advanced, and printing color images switched to using magenta and cyan to get a wider, more accurate range of colors.Our eyes see three basic colors of light: Red, Green, and Blue. Cyan pigment only absorbs one color from light, Red; this leaves behind Blue and Green. Magenta pigment absorbs only Green. Yellow pigment absorbs Blue. Mix those three in varying combinations and you can get every color the human eye can perceive. (Technically you don't need Black in CMYK, but it takes a lot of CMY to get a good, dark Black.)In contrast, Red Yellow and Blue can only be mixed to most visible colors, but there are some that are simply not possible to create with those three as your \"primary\" colors.The reason Yellow \"gets a pass\" is because it is a primary color in color schemes for both subtractive light and traditional art.So why did we use Red Yellow Blue for so long? Because (a) for a long time we didn't know enough about light to know Cyan and Magenta are better primaries, and (b) Cyan and Magenta pigments are hard to make, requiring (relatively) modern processes."}, {"date": "25/12/19", "score": 631, "text": "I've actually been wondering this for a while but since this post is about printing...

A lot of blues and oranges are impossible to reproduce in CMY for example, that's where extra colors in custom prints come in. And CMY will only in theory produce black.

RYB has the limitation that red and blue are (generally) very saturated colorants. Meaning, the lightest red you can make is still very much red. You can't really make a good magenta out of RYB colors, because the red is simply too strong.Magenta in this case is more or less a much less saturated red. Cyan is much less saturated blue. This means we can get lighter, brighter, and more vibrant colors. The addition of K (short for Key) black means we can get pure, dark blacks, with the extra benefit of not saturating the medium with a ton of CMY.CMYK can produce most colors the eye can see. RYB can, in turn, produce a large portion of the colors CMYK can.To frame it a different way, say your eye can see at 1080p; CMYK has a color resolution of 920p, where RYB is about 720p.Because the CMYK color space uses purer primary colors, it has a higher resolution to work in."}, {"date": "25/12/19", "score": 3, "text": "Mix those three in varying combinations and you can get every color the human eye can perceive.Uh, no not reallyFor starters cmyk can't print white, pastels, neons, gold, silver etc."}, {"date": "25/12/19", "score": 3, "text": "So why did we use Red Yellow Blue for so long?

This causes the sock to stick to your skin. People saying polarity of the water matter are implicitly implying that oil soaked clothing wouldn't stick to your skin which is untrue. But why does surface tension matter? When the sock is in contact with your skin water droplets bridge the gaps between the fabric and you. These bridges make capillary forces that attract you to the sock. These are the same forces that make wet sand stick to things. These forces also vanish when the contact is fully flodded (which is why you can't build an underwater sand castle and clothes don't stick to you underwater).In the case of the car, the scale has changed now the capillary forces are too small to be important compared to the other forces. In this case hydrodynamic forces (forces that move water about) dominate and these are enough to keep the surfaces separated.

positive. Because of its polarity, water likes to stick to other polar molecules, including itself. Your skin is somewhat polar, too, which is why sweat and water stick to it. A wet sock is a mesh filled with water, which then sticks to you.Furthermore, wet clothing isn't very permeable to air. It might be able to form a weak seal against your skin, if you squeeze any air underneath it out. That'll require extra force to break.Finally, wet clothing is considerably heavier than dry clothing. That may provide a higher normal force and thereby frictive force on the top of your foot.Instead of sliding your entire sock on, I suggest you smush your sock so it looks like a circle, place your toes in, and then roll the rest on like a wet, foot condom. Or forego wearing wet socks at all. They may lead to blisters....edit: Some comments.Morning has come and your replies showed me that I answered a different question. My b.

For terms of demonstration, sliding state might have a coefficient of 0.15, whereas that same material might be a 0.5 otherwise.

Better paper has more and longer fibres, but most of it is a mesh of randomly stuck-together incredibly thin pieces of, well, wood. And it has a little thickness to it, not much, but a little.So if you grab a pair of reasonably sharp scissors and put them at the edge of a piece of loosely held paper, there's not a very clean contact at that edge where the fibres of the paper move along the scissors' shearing edge to the point where they get cut. It's kind of like cutting steak by pressing your knife down on it instead of sawing; the meat gets squashed a little rather than severed because too many fibres in the meat are interacting with too little edge of your knife. Same with the paper because even though it's very thin, it still has SOME thickness to it. So it's hard to get your scissors and gliding motion started, and you end up with a crinkled little ripped area on your paper.Two ways to fix this are to hold the paper taut, so there's a very clean contact between both the top and bottom fibres at the paper's edge and the two cutting surfaces of the scissors, or to make a small cut and have the scissors build up some velocity and then carry that through into a glide. Either way causes the fibres at the top and bottom of the paper sheet to travel ALONG the cutting blade surfaces of the scissors while preventing too many fibres from jamming against the cutting surfaces all at once.Now you are getting LOTS of cutting surface handling a LITTLE bit of paper fibres at once, so they can slice rather than crush, and that's much much better for cutting. And then you get that satisfying whi-i-i-i-ish of the scissors travelling effortlessly in a perfect straight line, and the crowd goes wild!P.S. this is also why scissors with a little damage to the blades really suck at glide-cutting. Even the tiniest of dents in the cutting surface becomes a place where lots of fibres can clog up, and suddenly you're ripping things worse than a competitive event at an all-you-can-eat chili buffet."}, {"date": "25/12/19", "score": 1400, "text": "You sure know a lot about paper, any chance you\u2019re a salesperson in a medium sized paper company based out of Scranton, PA?"}, {"date": "25/12/19", "score": 9, "text": "So in effect paper has a 'grain' just like lumber?"}, {"date": "25/12/19", "score": 6, "text": "Sounds like something Dunder Mifflin salesperson would say."}, {"date": "25/12/19", "score": 7, "text": "I wish all eli5 responses have a tl;dr like this coz most are more eli10-eli15 than eli5"}, {"date": "25/12/19", "score": 2, "text": "So Well wood is the best wood for paper."}, {"date": "25/12/19", "score": 2, "text": "Is there also friction involved here?

I assume they want to know about the theory of relativity, so I'll give it a go:Imagine you're driving a car at 30mph, and another car overtakes you at 60mph. Common experience tells us that someone standing stationary at the side of the road will observe the overtaking car going at 60mph, whereas from your perspective it is going at 30mph.Now imagine that you are driving a car at 30mph (13.4m/s) and your shine a light. From your perspective the light is travelling at the speed of light ( 299\u00a0792\u00a0458 m/s). Common experience tells us that the person at the side of the road will see that light travelling at 30 mph + the speed of light (299\u00a0792\u00a0471 m/s). But that doesn't happen, both observers see the light travelling at the exact same speed (299 792 458 m/s). Einstein's theory says that the speed of light can never be broken no matter what frame of reference you measure it from. That means if someone is another car travelling at half the speed of light, the light shone is still travelling at 299792458 m/s relative to them.So how does this work? Well, speed is distance over time - so for speed to be fixed distance or time have to change within your frame of reference. Turns out both do depending on your reference frame. But for the car, time slows down relative to the guy who is stationary. The effect is very negligible until you reach speeds close to the speed of light.It's not just a theory, it's been verified using atomic clocks.As to how/why this works? I have no clue, I'm not sure anyone does."}, {"date": "24/01/20", "score": 7, "text": "This last sentence is the real answer"}, {"date": "25/01/20", "score": null, "text": "I'm finding it hard to wrap my head around something.

So when the guy in the car stops his car, his watch should be lagging behind, right?But this isn't making sense to me. Because the stationary man actually is just traveling at 0.5 c relative to the guy in the car. And if you take the guy in the car to be the observer, then it should appear to him that stationary man is experiencing time more slowly.  Which would be paradoxical.

A satellite placed at that height over the equator will seem to be stationary from the perspective of the Earth's surface.  This is a geostationary or geosynchronous orbit.

Magnets will line themselves up so their loops are going the same way. When we talk about magnetic poles we are ignoring the part of the loop that goes through the magnetic object. It comes from an earlier model of magnetism, which gives the wrong answer for magnetic fields inside things, but works pretty well outside things.This neat diagram shows how the Earth's magnetic field lines work; they go through the middle of the Earth, out in the Southern Hemisphere, and loop around to go back into the Earth in the Northern Hemisphere. [The \"g\" poles are the geographic poles, so due to the Earth's rotation, and the \"m\" ones are the magnetic poles.]The exact shape of this field depends on the structure of all the stuff inside the Earth (which is generating this field); but a lot of that stuff is in liquid form (or, at least, has liquidy properties) so moves around, and that causes shifts in the field lines. They sort of flow around.So what do we mean by a \"magnetic North pole\" given that there aren't really magnetic poles, just loops?The Magnetic North Pole is defined as the point on the Earth's surface where the magnetic field lines are travelling straight down into the ground (not at some angle). If you held a magnet there, the North part of it would point straight down. Anywhere else it would be slightly tilted. [Note - this means the magnetic North pole is actually a magnetic \"south\" pole - i.e. a thing that north poles are attracted to.]As the inside of the Earth moves around a bit, its magnetic field will shift, and so this point will flow around a bit. It used to be around Canada, but in the last few years has moved close to the geographic North, and is now heading off towards Russia.We can define the \"magnetic South pole\" in a similar way (the point on the Earth's surface where magnetic field lines go straight up), but there is no reason why it should be directly opposite to the magnetic North pole; they're actually a bit off as the field isn't symmetric.There are also the geomagnetic North and South poles. If we pretend the Earth's magnetic field is caused by a bar magnet (it isn't, but we can approximate it), those are where we would put the ends of the bar magnet.Having said that, the Earth's magnetic field is quite a bit more complicated (that is a computer model of the magnetic field).If you are interested. Wikimedia has some handy maps (from 2014 - so out of date now) showing how the magnetic field strength varies across the Earth's surface (stronger near the poles, weaker near the Equator), how the inclination of the field varies (0 degrees is where the field is perfectly horizontal, 90 degrees where it is vertical - so at the magnetic poles), and how the declination of the field varies (so how wrong your compass is - the angle between the direction a compass would point and the geographic North or South pole; 0 degrees it is pointing in the right direction)."}, {"date": "29/01/20", "score": null, "text": "This ends here.

Gamma rays, visible light, and radio waves are all examples of electromagnetic radiation, and  you're right that radio waves (with a wavelength of meters), are much less energetic than visible light (with a wavelength of around 5 x 10^-7 meters).Three things happen to EM radiation when it encounters a barrier.  It can bounce ( reflectance or scattering), pass through (transmittance), or just plain stop (absorbance).The intensity of radiation transmitted depends on several things:The wavelength of the radiationThe intensity of the radiation hitting the barrierThe chemical composition of the barrierThe physical microstructure of the barrierThe thickness of the barrierYour question has to do with #1, but keep in mind that powerful enough visible light (many times  brighter than sunlight) would be able to pass through the walls of your home so you could see it, and even a weak light can shine through a paper-thin wall or a wall made of glass. Now as for your question, imagine an ant and an elephant standing next to each other.  The ant doesn't know the elephant is there because it's too big and the elephant doesn't know the ant is  there because it's too small.  EM waves interact with matter in a similar way:  on their own scale of size and time.The reason why visible light can't travel through walls as easily as gamma rays or radio waves is because, to the visible light, there's something 'there' on a similar scale of length (wavelength) and time (frequency) that the gamma rays are too small and fast to interact with and the radio waves are too large and slow to interact with. The gamma rays just pass through the spaces between and within atoms and molecules. They're small enough to do that. If your walls were made of pure lead, they'd have a little more trouble. The radio waves on the other hand are large enough to ignore the walls because they're too thin. But if you've ever tried to listen to a radio in a tunnel or a cave, you know that radio waves have  trouble penetrating through meters of earth.Visible light interacts with many solid materials because the wavelengths are the right size to be scattered by structural elements within those materials like microfibers and cracks and porous spaces.  Well-cut glass or diamond don't have these structural elements at this length scale so they look clear unless they're shattered or rough. So scattering due to physical elements of the right size is a major reason, but another factor contributes too.Visible light also interacts with pigments in the paint on surface of your wall.  This occurs  because the pigment molecules have chemical bonds within them that only vibrate at certain  frequencies. When visible light at that frequency hits the molecule, it's absorbed.

I mean, action at a distance is spooky!One additional interesting thing about gravity is that its charge, mass, has implications in non-gravity as well, e.g. Newton's second law: F = m * a (the heavier the ball the harder you gotta throw it). That's distinct concept than gravitational mass there is no experimental difference found.Edit: Linked a better version of the video.

You're so close.F=ma is connected to inertia.  Which is different than gravity.  Infact, the two phenomena may very well be totally different.The Higgs boson attributs inertial mass to matter.  I'll say that again, as far as we know the Higgs has nothing to do with gravity.Back to the ELI5 question - \"How does mass have anything to do with gravity?\"  The how is simple and explained by Newtonian Gravity or General Relativity.  But I think they're actually asking \"Why does mass have anything to do with gravity?\"What's the difference?  How seeks to understand the mechanism by which something happens: how to measure and predict results. Why seems to understand the purpose by which something happens: what is the motivation of the creator(s) when they decided to make it this way.How is science.  Why is religion.How - the answer is we've measured that anything with mass has a gravitational effect.  We can predict how it affects other things with mass and have gotten very good at predicting what will happen.  We have explored for some underlying \"simpler\" mechanism but have not found any.  As far as we can tell: more mass makes more gravity and that's the way the universe works. (ok keeners, yes enough energy can also cause gravity but let's keep it ELI8-ish).Unsatisfying?  Well that's what happens at the bottom layer of reality.There's a saying:- All human behaviour can be explained by biology- All biology can be explained by chemistry- All chemistry can be explained by physics- All physics can be explained by mathematics- All mathematics can be explained by philosophy.Edit: titogruul did a great job, but the how/why thing is a big deal for young minds.

The blueberry rolls to the orange.Enjoy your fruit while you read this part.The tissue paper is called the spacetime fabric. It's in space and it's everywhere. Everytime you put something on that fabric, it distorts the fabric slightly and attracts things towards it, like how the blueberry rolls towards the orange. That is gravity or at least what the best theories explain it to be. Of course on earth the blueberry rolls because of earth's gravity. But you can imagine it in space where there is no gravity.

It is slowly pulling earth towards it only being held back by the forward momentum of the earth. However, the sun is not pulling the earth towards itself because the sun is burning trillions of tons of gas every day and is therefore losing alot of mass, which brings me to next part. Things with less mass have less 'gravity' or a lower tendency to pull things towards it.You can use g=GM/r\u00b2 to find how strong the gravitational field strength of an object is. G is a gravitational constant which doesn't change, m is mass and r is the radius of said object.

But I think you need to compare this to other things based on the same principle: boats and hot air balloons.Keep in mind that a hot air balloon used to lift people off the ground is also VERY heavy. Adding hot air to it doesn't change that. What matters is that the weight of the air it displaces is more than the balloon's (plus the basket and riders) weight, so it floats.When the weight of a boat is less than the weight of the water it's displaced, the boat floats. If the boat shrinks a LOT but weight ''slightly'' less, it will have a net sinking effect because it's displaced less water, but not enough to make up for the weight reduction.A small helium balloon shrinks and gets lighter, but now the ratio of weight to the balloon's rubber to helium goes in favour of the balloon rubber which is much heavier than air.

All these particles are moving. Any kind of circular motion in the cloud due to the movement of these particles is going to continue to be exhibited no matter what happens within the system: if the whole thing is spinning, it stays spinning overall, even if the tiny particles group together.

Or can some of the horizontal momentum actually be converted to vertical momentum?Momentum or kinetic energy certainly can be redirected this way in other settings. E.g. if you drive a car at speed towards a ramp, the ramp can launch you upwards (even if you take your foot of the accelerator when you hit the ramp). Or think of a ski jumper doing a similar thing. Clearly rolling and gliding motion can be redirected from a horizontal (or even downward) direction to an upward direction.

Every time you land while running, some energy is stored inside the tendons in your legs, which is released when you push off for the next stride. This helps you to run faster and more efficiently.

If you do this on a slippery surface (e.g a well-polished floor) the opposing force may be enough to push you back a little.If you push against something in space, the opposite force is totally obvious. If you pushed against a book in space, the book would go flying in one direction quite fast, and you would drift off in the opposite direction much more slowly. If you push against something that's the same weight (or mass, to be more precise) as you, then you both go flying off in opposite directions at the same speed.So in short: yes, the opposite force is always there as Newton said. If there is a force from A to B, then there is the same force from B to A. But what these forces do to A and B depends on their properties (mostly their mass). The same force acting on a light thing may cause it to shoot away at speed, while it doesn't even budge a heavy thing, because it's not enough to overcome the friction between the heavy thing and the surface it sits on."}, {"date": "30/01/20", "score": null, "text": "Think about what the universe would be like if this WASN'T the case.I would be able to take a car door, punch it with all my strength to dent it, and my hand will not get injured or even feel a thing because Netwon's third law no longer applied.I'd be able to take a flimsy piece of wood and hit a brick wall with it with all my strength but the flimsy piece of wood would not break because Newton's third law no longer applied.The two situations above, are of course, not the case in this universe.

Autorotation (described by /u/jacklychi) allows helicopters to make controlled landings without an engine very easily, and helicopters get just as many safety inspections as any other aircraft, more or less, if they are for commercial transportation.The biggest difference is that helicopters are used primarily for low, short flights between nearby destinations. Autorotation requires a certain height above the ground in order to work - that means if a helicopter loses and engine it's safer if you're higher up. Except that most helicopters are flying lower to the ground. That makes autorotation more difficult. And since helicopters are usually flying over populated areas it's less likely that a helicopter will be able to find a clear, open place to land. Although autorotation allows a helicopter to land safely if it has a place to land, they still don't have glide slopes - you're not going to get very far, only straight down. A plane will be flying probably much higher and although a landing without an engine is more dangerous, they will at least have more energy and lift to travel horizontally to a safer, emptier place.The tendency for helicopters to be used for lower, shorter flights also puts them closer to obstacles like power lines, buildings, birds, and even tall trees. In the case of the Kobe crash, it crashed into a hillside. Visibility was poor. Although the cause has not yet been determined, it could be as simple as the pilot misread the instruments and didn't see the hillside until it was too late to avoid it. Compare that to most passenger planes which would be flying so high that not being able to see the terrain isn't an issue, because there isn't any. I have zero other information, I'm not saying that was the cause, I am only suggesting that it could be a cause which is generally not true of most commercial passenger flights.The other problem is that helicopters are more likely to be privately owned and operated, at least compared to big passenger planes. Those are regulated very strictly. Although any flights are very regulated, a small for-hire helicopter service may not have the same stringency applied to it as other modes of air travel.

The faster the back and forth, the shorter the wavelength. It is quite difficult to force currents to do this back and forth fast enough to produce short-wavelength light.Incandescent light bulbs produce visible light by heating something up enough to where it glows a specific color. To get e.g. UV light, you would have to heat something up CRAZY hot, which is not really feasible for both energy consumption reasons and also because many materials would just burn up at these temperatures.Now, an alternative is to shoot an electron beam into a series of magnetic fields where each new magnetic field is in the opposite direction of the last. You can then tune the strength of the magnetic fields and the speed of the electrons to produce a similar \"back and forth\" effect but at much higher rates. This is how a typical X-ray machine works.For even higher wavelengths like gamma rays, you can use particle collisions to produce them. For example, a PET scan works by putting a radioactive dye into your blood. The blood carries the radioactive particles all around your body, where they decay into something else by emitting an antimatter electron (called a positron). Since your body is FULL of electrons, this positron very quickly finds one and when matter meets antimatter, they annihilate, in this case producing two hard X-ray/gamma ray photons which can be detected by the machine."}]}, {"question": "ELI5: How is it theoretically possible for gravity to have infinite range throughout the universe?", "author_name": "vexed_chexmix", "date": "23/02/20", "flair": "Physics", "answers": [{"date": "06/02/20", "score": 11, "text": "It can be a bit counter-intuitive at first, given how most interactions in everyday life need some direct interaction between objects, but gravity exists between any 2 objects that have mass, even if they aren't in any sort of direct contact otherwise.The force of gravity between objects decreases at an inverse square of the distance between them(meaning, we divide by an ever larger number), but never by a flat amount, so it simply never reaches 0.How it's theoretically possible for such a thing to even exist?

At the time, when Einstein formulated general relativity, he made further discoveries and hypotheses based on the model that he came up with, many of whichj were verified. In the mathematics, for it to be fully correct there was a number that shows up. To account for it, many people reasoned intuitively that the number should be 0. Later on in the 90s, when it was discovered that some data showed the expansion of the universe was accelerating, the theorists realized that this cannot be true if that number were really 0. This number could be a lot less simple than just a number, and in the equations it represented what people called \u201cdark energy\u201d. As for your question, it\u2019s not really about \u201ccreating new space\u201d or abstract notions, it\u2019s simply that there was a variable that we thought was very simple (and equal to 0 so no contribution) but actually fairly complex and today we can\u2019t really account for.The slightly more metaphorical explanation is basically, say you threw a ball into the air, eventually, it falls back down. After the big bang, stars, like the ball and the earth, flew into opposite directions. We later discovered that not only did the stars never fall back down, it kept going faster and faster than it had before. If this happened in your room, you might expect something was wrong. The ball falls away from the ground, like a sort of anti-gravity. Einstein\u2019s equations allows for some thing that counteracts gravity, ie the expansion of space.

There are many different units, so for example you can measure time in seconds, minutes, hours, days, years, etc. Similarly, you can measure distance in kilometres, centimetres, inches, you name it.To avoid confusion, and to make sure people speak in the same language using the same units, we have developed an international system of units (called SI from the French name) which is intended to be the \"basic\" system of measurement. (Disclaimer: Other systems are used and I pass no judgment on whether one is better than the others...)There are seven base units, which are:kilogramme (kg) for masssecond (s) for timemetre (m) for lengthampere (A) for electric currentKelvin (K) for temperaturemole (mol) for the amount of \"stuff\" you have (physical substance)candela (cd) for how much light there is (intensity of light)Everything else is derived from these units.So how does that help with your question? Well, the metre per second square (or metre per second per second) is the SI unit for acceleration. Let's break it down into the base units:Imagine you want to measure a car's speed, and you want to express it in SI units. To explain speed to someone you say that the car moved X metres (distance) in Y seconds (time).So your unit for speed is X (m) / Y(s) = m/s or metre per second. The way to look at it is that units in the SI system form part of the equation, so if you divide metres by seconds, your result is in m/s.Now, let's imagine you want to know what the car's acceleration was. What is acceleration? Acceleration is the rate of change of speed over time.In very basic terms, if you have a car going from a dead stop (0 m/s) to a speed of 1 m/s (so in one second it has moved one metre), you calculate the average acceleration of the car as:speed / time interval, which is (1 m/s) / (1 s) - this gives you a result in m/s/s or m/s2TLDR: The SI unit of acceleration is m/s2, sometimes called metre per second per second.

stable shape since it has the most even distribution of matter and pressure and it's the closest to equilibrium matter can be in.  Imagine if the world was a cube.  The outer corners of the cube would be further away from the earth's core, and therefore experience less gravitational pull than the center of the faces of the cube.

That is a way of saying that these parts stand \"higher\" on the surface than what surrounds them, like for example a mountain. Due to gravity, that part will then fall down, until it gets to the same altitude as the rest around it. Eventually, all parts making the surface are at the same height, and nothing can fall any further down. Because everything is the same altitude (distance from center), that's a way to say the planet is now round.That applies to every body in space, but it depends on how strong gravity is on it (bigger body =stronger gravity), and how hard is its crust. A liquid planet will always be very round, as nothing can not fall down closer to the center, if there is anywhere to fall.  A rocky smallish planet like Earth can have a few mountains standing up, making it a bit less round. An astetoid has very little gravity and it's rock-hard, so it can be very far from round.Plus, spinning make planets a bit flat, like when a pizza maker spins the pizza over his head to flatten it, but just a tiny bit.

All that energy locked and loaded and just waiting for something to start the reaction.You toss a golf ball in the room and then quickly close the door and as the first mousetraps go off, they fly around, landing on other traps, which sets off other traps, and you have an exponential chain reaction. The more mousetraps go off, the more mousetraps want to go off. At a certain point in this faster and faster triggering of the traps, they pretty much all go off at the same time. You've just started a nuclear meltdown because the reaction was allowed to go as fast as it could without any control. If you took the room itself and crushed it down to a smaller size so that all the mouse traps were touching each other and could go off even faster, that is like what a nuclear bomb does. The conditions are so perfect, that the chain reaction takes place instantly.Now imagine that you had pillows you could drop in from the ceiling that slowed down how quickly the mouse traps could go off, slowing it down. The more pillows, the slower the reaction, but too many pillows and the mouse traps would just stop, but too few and they would exponentially trigger out of control. There is a sweet spot where the mouse traps go off continuously, but at a controlled rate, this is what nuclear reactor designs strive for but using control rods instead of pillows, and Uranium 235 instead of mouse traps.The uranium decays releasing neutrons which can strike other uranium atoms, making it more likely they will decay, which releases more neutrons, like the mouse traps going off faster and faster. By inserting neutron absorbing control rods around these uranium fuel rods, you can slow down the reaction, or even stop it all together. Every time the uranium decays, you get neutron radiation, heat, and decay elements being created. By collecting this heat with molten salts or water, they can drive steam turbines just like other power plants, and generate electricity.Contrast this with a nuclear bomb which has the uranium (lets just assume it's a U235 bomb) packed in so tightly and compressed by conventional explosives that it immediately goes into a chain reaction, exponentially ramping up in the form of an explosion.

Simply put, atoms of all kinds tend to absorb spare neutrons from their surroundings. In the case of atoms of nuclear fuel, these extra neutrons interrupt the structure of the atom so much that the atoms simply fall apart (ie split). In a way, nuclear fuel atoms are like a human pyramid. If you add a random extra person to the pyramid, it gets unstable and everyone falls down.Back to atoms though, as the atom falls apart, some of the fragments that fly off are neutrons. These neurons are typically moving very fast. The thing about fast moving neutrons though is that they are hard for other atoms to absorb. Occasionally an atom will successfully grab a passing fast neutron, but not very often. So a nuclear chain reaction is hard to keep going because most of the neutrons fly away too fast to split any other atoms.In a nuclear bomb, this problem is solved by packing a huge density of fuel atoms as closely together as possible. So, even though the probability of any one atom grabbing the fast moving neutrons is low, there's so many atoms that the probability of at least one atom grabbing each neutron is both enough to sustain a nuclear reaction.In a nuclear reactor, the problem is solved by stacking up layers of nuclear fuel in between layers of something else (like water or graphite) called a moderator. When a fuel atom splits, it releases fast neutrons which quickly fly right out of the fuel layer into the layer of moderator, which slows the neutrons down. By the time the neutrons get all the way across the moderator layer and into the next layer of fuel, they are moving at a speed slow enough to be easily absorbed.The nuclear bomb approach gives a device that is fairly lightweight but very prone to a runaway reaction and requires expensive premium fuel, which is perfect for a bomb but not really for a power plant. The nuclear reactor approach creates a device that is very heavy, but can run on low grade fuel and is much more controllable. Not great for a bomb, but good for a power plant.Prompt Criticality vs Delayed CriticalityWhen an atom of nuclear fuel falls apart it immediately leaves behind fragments including neutrons (called prompt neutrons), a variety of particles and whole unstable atoms. Some of these unstable atoms will then release more neutrons after a few seconds (the are called delayed neutrons). If exactly 1 of the neutrons (either prompt or delayed) from every fuel atom that splits causes one more fuel atom to split, then a stable chain reaction is occuring. If more than one neutron from each fuel atom causes another atom to split, then the chain reaction accelerates.For a bomb, we want the chain reaction to accelerate very rapidly. So we design the device to ensure that more than one of the prompt neutrons from every fuel atom causes another fuel atom to split. This causes the reaction to accelerate to maximum in a matter of nano seconds and release all its energy suddenly and destructively.For a power station, we want the chain reaction to be stable and only accelerate slowly when we want it to. To achieve this, we design it so that almost enough (but not quite enough) of the prompt neutrons causes another split. A chain reaction is then only possible if enough of the delayed neutrons also cause a split after a second or two. This delay causes the reaction to accelerate slowly and gives the operator a chance to use control rods to absorb some of the neutrons and keep the chain reaction at exactly the intended power."}, {"date": "01/02/20", "score": null, "text": "Since the answer has already been pretty well explained, I'll add that if you get the chance, check out Jared Harris' testimony in the last episode of the Chernobyl miniseries.

Now I'm just a 60-year-old retired former English professor and lawyer with a faulty memory of the physics stuff I knew when I was a smart teenager, but I can try to explain.When you point your radio telescope at the night sky, you pick up emissions all along the radio spectrum. Hydrogen clouds emit radiation at a known spectrum, but these emissions get Doppler-shifted up and down in frequency depending on the movement of the clouded with respect to the Earth.(The Doppler effect is what makes an ambulance siren change in pitch as it goes by - high-pitched as the siren approaches, squeezing the sound waves, lower pitched as it drives away, stretching them out.)So back to the radio telescope. When you map out your emissions along the line in which you were pointing your telescope, you get several big bumps at certain frequencies. These are clumps of hydrogen clouds at certain distances. Actually, they represent a cross section of the spiral arms of our galaxy. But to build the whole picture, you have to repeat the process pointing your radio telescope at every point of the Milky Way.When they put this all together back in the day, they got a picture of vague lumpy and broken  bands of matter forming sort of elliptical ripples.

Today you can see a picture of dozens of spiral galaxies in a single frame.Radio astronomy has also improved. You have to know a lot of chemistry and mathematics to interpret the radio emissions it picks up, but it is how scientists detect and assess the chemical compositions of remote objects and clouds of gas. A lot of deep space images you see are visual reconstructions of data gleaned in this way.There - I've tapped out my knowledge in this area and probably committed some howlers in describing what I never completely understood even back in the day (I always sucked at chemistry) but hopefully enough for you to research more if you're interested."}, {"date": "07/02/20", "score": null, "text": "Thank you kind sir!

You probably see larger or smaller things everyday for your entire life, so your brain know that large things move slow and small things move fast.

So if a 2-meter man falls over, the entire process takes less than a second.

This is not by chance: as someone else has mentioned, it's the result of the square-cube law, which means a bigger animal would be proportionally to their size less strong than us, and thus will be less fast and agile. So a real-life giant would indeed be pretty slow and clumsy."}, {"date": "03/02/20", "score": 3, "text": "Because in the real world, small animals tend to move quickly relative to their body size, and big animals tend to move slowly.Think of a mouse or insect. It can scurry about very quickly, moving at way more body lengths per second than us, or than other, larger animals. Consider an elephant, for instance. It is large and lumbering and its movements are slower relative to its size.Let's look at some numbers to make this more concrete. Usain Bolt has a top speed of about 12 m/s, or well over six body lengths per second. A house mouse can run at over 3 m/s, but its body is less than 10 cm long, so it can do more than 30 body lengths per second. That's faster (by this measure) than a cheetah, which tops out at a measly 16 body lengths per second. An elephant has a top speed of about 11 m/s, relative to an average body length of about 4 m, so it can do about 2.5 body lengths per second.So, elephants are about as fast as humans (at top speed), but look a lot slower while doing it. Mice are slower than us but look faster. And it's all in these numbers of speed relative to size.Giants, if they existed, would be no different. They might outrun the fastest humans, but relative to their body size they would look slower. E.g. maybe your giant stands 10 m tall and runs at 20 m/s, which is way faster than a human. But, that giant still does only two body lengths per second, compared to our six. She will also be taking fewer, though larger steps. So, all in all, her movement looks a lot slower than those of a human running at top speed.The reason why bigger animals get slower compared to their body size has to do with square-cube laws that govern biomechanics. For instance, if you scale up an animal by a certain factor, its weight will increase with the cube of that factor, while its muscle cross-section (which governs its muscle strength) increases more slowly, with the square of the scaling factor (e.g. if you double the size, the animal's weight increases eight-fold while the muscle cross section only quadruples). This makes it harder for animals with larger bodies to apply the same force per weight to their limbs as a smaller animal (they could grow larger muscles to compensate, but only to a point). Their muscles and limbs are still bigger so they can put out more power and be faster on the whole, but relative to their bodies big animals tend to be weaker (and slower).(Of course this is only a general principle, and there is lots of variation between animals of the same size, depending on whether they evolved to prioritize speed.)"}, {"date": "03/02/20", "score": null, "text": "Damn.

The water drop will freeze.Edit: Napkin math says that you need at least 2.5 times as much ice (-20 \u00b0C) as water (+4 \u00b0C) for the water to start freeze."}, {"date": "09/02/20", "score": 3, "text": "/u/Nimradd this here above is the complete answer.It's also important to mention another aspect of temperature:The energy of a system is what determines what temperature, but the temperature itself is what determines the rate of heat exchange.(example: iron needs more energy than air to change temperature, but if both are at say 20 \u00b0C, both will stay that way, even though the iron has overall \"more\" energy, only the temperature equalizes, not the total energy) This will become important a bit below.Water doesn't freeze instantly at 0 \u00b0C, and it doesn't freeze for free. There is an energy requirement to change solid water(ice) into liquid water(well, water), all the while it stays at 0 \u00b0C, so if you put a certain amount of 0 \u00b0C ice and 0 \u00b0C water together, nothing will really change.This amount needed to change the state of the water is roughly equal to the amount needed to change water's temperature by 80 \u00b0C. This creates a really weird situation, because by the amount of energy needed for freezing/thawing, you could almost consider 0 \u00b0C ice to be -80 \u00b0C water. If you put equal amounts of 0 \u00b0C ice and 80 \u00b0C water, the whole thing would end up being 0 \u00b0C water. Thawing that 0 \u00b0C ice into 0 \u00b0C water took the same energy as cooling that 80 \u00b0C water to also 0 \u00b0C water.This is where the weird stuff happens, and you should re-read the top bolded part. That 0 \u00b0C ice is NOT -80 \u00b0C water(only has the same energy that cold water would theoretically have, if freezing wasn't a thing), so even though the 0 \u00b0C water has more energy than the 0 \u00b0C ice, because their temperature is the same, putting them together will change absolutely nothing. The ice will stay frozen, the water will stay liquid. If one was hotter or colder, the other half would compensate by freezing/thawing before moving away from the 0 \u00b0C point.Another important part: The specific heat capacity, the amount of energy needed to change something by 1 \u00b0C is half as much for ice as it is for liquid water, so if you wanted to add equal amounts of ice and water, and wanted no freezing or thawing to occur at all, the ice would need to be twice as much below 0 \u00b0C as your water is above.Considering all this, let's see what would happen to your -20 \u00b0C ice block and your 4 \u00b0C water(let's be lazy and make it 5 \u00b0C):If you add just twice the amount of water(at 5 \u00b0C) as your ice(at -20 \u00b0C), both will end up at 0 \u00b0C. Add a larger ratio of ice, and some of the water will freeze.

Heat always flows from a hot region to a cold region. That is an idea so basic that they had to go back and make it a law after they had already named the first law (energy can not be created or destroyed) so the law that heat flows from hot to cold is called the \"zeroth law of thermodynamics\"So we know that a hot object will give its heat to all the cold things around it. There are three ways that heat can move. It can be conducted from one object to another just because the objects are touching. Also, heat will be conducted from the hot part of an object to the cooler part of the same object. To feel this in action, get a copper wire and heat one end. Copper is a great conductor of heat: you will feel the cool end warm up quite quickly.The second way heat can move is by convection. That is when a fluid, like air or water, flows past the hot object and picks up heat as it goes by. A hot fluid can also transfer heat to a cooler object that it is flowing past. In fact a car radiator is a good example of convection: hot water flows through the tubes of the radiator and heats up the metal. Then cool air flows over the outside of the radiator and picks up the heat and carries it away. Convection inside and outside.The third way to transfer heat is by radiation, and oddly, a radiator does not use this method. Radiation is the way heat from the sun gets to Earth even though the space between is a vacuum. The heat is carried by electromagnetic waves, including good old light, and waves not quite long enough for humans to see, called infrared waves. Light can travel through a vacuum, and it carries the heat with it. It is worth noting that to get any decent amount of heat by radiation, the hot object has to be really hot."}, {"date": "14/02/20", "score": 2, "text": "Thanks for the detailed answer!"}, {"date": "14/02/20", "score": 2, "text": "Cold is the absence from heat (energy).

Heat flows from areas of high concentration (hot things) to areas of low concentration (cold things).The atoms and molecules in a substance are moving and have a certain amount of energy contained in them.  On a macroscopic scale, this is thermal energy.  So the molecules in a hot piece of metal are moving faster and contain more energy than the ones in a lower temperature piece of metal.  This energy is lost through three methods.Conduction: This is when a solid is in physical contact with another solid and the atoms transfer energy from one solid to another.Convection: This is when heat is transferred by moving fluids at a macroscopic level.  This can be a solid to a fluid (or vice versa) or fluid to fluid.  At an atomic or molecular level this occurs by atoms and molecules bouncing off of each other.Radiation: This is when individual atoms loose energy by emitting light (think of a hot piece of metal).

Why is it bad?", "author_name": "curiousfrosty", "date": "23/02/20", "flair": "Physics", "answers": [{"date": "13/02/20", "score": 8, "text": "Radiation is, simply, either a particle or a wave that transmits energy through a medium. There are three types of radiation.Beta radiation. Beta radiation is a single, very high energy electron.Alpha radiation. Alpha radiation is the nucleus of a helium atom. Again, very highly chargedElectromagnetic radiation. Now, this is the interesting one, and the focus of your question.Electromagnet radiation is a wave of pure energy. It consists of two components - an oscillating electric wave and an oscillating magnetic wave; hence, electromagnetism. Think of old-timey space cartoons where the aliens have blaster rays that emit waves of pure energy - that's basically exactly what electromagnetic waves are.I'm sure you've heard of the electromagnetic spectrum - you start at radio, move up to microwave, then to infrared, then visible, then ultraviolet, x-ray, gamma, etc. These are all just electromagnetic waves - they're all just light rays. We can only see 'visible' light because that's the narrow band of wavelengths that we evolved the ability to detect.As the wavelength of the wave gets shorter and shorter, the energy packed into it goes up and up. Think of it like a spring - the tighter and tighter you wind the spring, the more and more energy gets stored in it. Radio is the weakest with very big wavelengths the size of buildings, and gamma rays are the strongest, with wavelengths smaller than atomic nuclei. Obviously the energy differences are huge.The lower parts of the spectrum are so weak that they don't harm us at all - they simply don't have enough energy to do anything to us. We can use things like microwaves and radio waves safely with no ill-affect. But, when you go higher up the spectrum, the waves begin to get so powerful that they begin to ionise atoms. This means that they have so much energy that they fly into atoms like a bullet and essentially shatter them, tearing them apart due to how much energy the radiation has. This is why radiation is dangerous - because it will rip through your atoms. Specifically, it rips through the atoms that make up the DNA in your cells, which tell your cells how to work properly. It can either destroy the cell completely, causing it and you to slowly decay, or it can damage the DNA enough to corrupt the cell and stop it from dying when it should - which is what we call cancer.X-rays take pictures of bone because X-rays are strong enough to pass through flesh and muscle, but they're not strong enough to pass through dense, thick bone. When you have an X-ray, your hand sits on a plate that's sensitive to X-ray light. X-rays are fired at the hand, and the X-rays hitting muscle and tissue pass straight through, leaving a mark on the plate, and the X-rays that hit bone don't get through, which means you get left with a negative imprint of what the bone looks like on the plate. That X-ray technicians hand looked like that because while one X-ray won't harm you, being exposed to thousands of X-rays will. Think about it, you only get one X-ray, but the technician is using his hands to set up that X-ray equipment dozens of times a day. He gets much more radiation, and those mangled hands are due to the X-rays damaging his DNA and stopping his bodies ability to heal.You can feel radiation if it's strong enough - it's usually described as a prickling, hot sensation on the skin, as well as a strong taste of metal in the mouth due to how it reacts with your taste buds. If you can feel radiation, though, you are very, very dead.Another note: beta and alpha radiation can cause the same effects as electromagnetic radiation, too.

They can also hurt you if you are hit with enough of them like a laser.At shorter wavelength they can cause cancer.Gamma rays are the far end of short wavelength of electromagnetic radiation.Nuclear radiation are the sort of things created by nuclear reactions. this can be gamma rays, but also include alpha and beta rays.Where gamma rays are still the same stuff as light, alpha and beta rays are actually particles: hydrogen atoms and electrons going extremely fast.Alpha, beta and gamma rays have the potential to cause cancer if they hit you.Too much radiation especially the cancer causing kind is bad for you.

Also, radiation is neither good or bad, it just exists.First off, Alpha radiation. Atoms are made up of subatomic particles called electrons, protons and neutrons. The protons and neutrons are stuck together as the nucleus. In very big nucleuses, the forces that hold them together are quite weak, and the nucleus can spontaneously split apart. When it does so, 2 neutrons and 2 protons fall off. This changes what element the original atom is, whilst the two neutrons and protons stick together as an atom of helium. This helium atom has a lot of energy, which can cause damage to life molecules, particularly DNA. This damage can turn normal cells into cancer cells. However, it also sucks at penetrating materials, so you can happily touch a source of alpha radiation and be fine - it's blocked by the surface layers of skin and clothing. Don't eat it though.The next is Beta radiation. This is a highly charged electron, which is created when a neutron within the nucleus of an unstable atom decides it wants to split to become a proton and an electron instead. There's also a positron version of this, where a proton decides to become a neutron and a positron instead. These cause damage to life in a similar way to alpha radiation - reacting with DNA, which changes it and can make a cell become cancerous. Beta radiation has more penetration than alpha radiation.Then there's electromagnetic radiation, which is typically high-energy light. This is stuff like x-rays, gamma rays and Ultraviolet rays. These have very high penetration, and are pretty dangerous. They work by transferring their energy to DNA, \"ionising\" it (ie putting it in a reactive state), which can confuse the DNA repair and replication mechanisms and make them put the wrong DNA subunit (nucleotide) in the wrong place, thereby changing what the DNA tells the cell to make. Have this happen in the wrong places and, as you may have guessed: cancer.Sufficiently powerful radiation can also straight up kill cells, either directly or by making the cells' self-destruct mechanisms turn on. If the cell isn't killed, it can become cancerous if the right combination of mutations happen: Mutations in genes that control cell replication that make the cell replicate more often; mutations in genes that kill cancer cells to make them not kill cancer cells, and mutations in genes that control how many times a cell can reproduce (you may have heard of telomeres in the context of aging - these are limits on the number of times a cell can reproduce, but mutations to proteins that control the telomeres can allow a cell to reproduce indefinitely). There are also like, 20 other types of gene that are also involved, but those three are the main ones."}, {"date": "13/02/20", "score": null, "text": "In the broadest technical sense, radiation is any source of energy, such as waves or particles, that radiates out into space from the surface of an object. Light for example, or thermal radiation, which can be felt when standing near a large campfire.  Power lines also lose energy by radiating low frequency radio waves out into space.While radiation in this broad sense could be harmful, in most cases it isn't. Indeed, visible light is a form of Electromagnetic Radiation. This is not harmful unless it's extremely concentrated, I.e. a focused LASER.Note the old saying that \"the difference between the cure and the poison is only in the dosage.\" Anything in too large amounts is harmful. And most harmful things, stop being dangerous if the amount is sufficiently small. Even Botulinum toxin A which is the deadliest known substance, can be used to treat wrinkles, migraines, and muscle spasms when used in tiny amounts.The most common usage of the term \"Radiation\" refers to Ionizing Radiation specifically.This means radiation that has high energy waves or high velocity particles, such that it is capable of stripping electrons from atoms and molecules it passes by.This is the type of radiation that is generally harmful.  This is because Ionizing Radiation has the ability to damage DNA in cells, hampering their ability to function or potentially killing them.Note that cells have DNA repair mechanisms that can almost always repair damage caused by Ronizing Radiation. However too much too fast stops the ability of cells to function.Moreover, modest amounts of Natural Background Radiation are constantly bombarding your body. These low levels aren't a health risk, however certain sources of NBR can increase cancer risk.There are six common types of Ionizing Radiation that a person would be likely to encounter.Ultraviolet light from the sun.This is invisible, and has a shorter wavelength and higher energy than visible light. It has the ability to damage DNA in cells in the skin, causing sunburn and skin cancer.2) gamma rays.These are very high energy photons given off by the nucleus of certain unstable elements. They have high penetrating power but are somewhat less dangerous than other types. That is, they are less prone to damage molecules in substances.Also, confusingly, gamma rays can be produced from objects deep in outer space such as neutron stars or supernovas. This is a result of some scientific ambiguity in the early 20th century3) X-raysThese are produced when electrons that have very high speed collide with dense elements like metals. They are similar to gamma rays but have less energy and less penetrating power.  These are mostly man-made.4) BetaThese are high velocity electrons given off by unstable nuclei of certain elements.These have low penetrating power, but they are one of the most common forms of Ionizing radiation. They are also more hazardous than gamma rays or X-rays.Beta electrons can also result in the production of some secondary x-rays if they collide with metals.5) Alpha particles.These are basically the bare nuclei of helium atoms, without any accompanying electrons.These are given off by very heavy elements on the bottom row of the periodic table, such as uranium or radium.Alpha particles have almost no penetrating power and are stopped by thick paper, aluminum foil, or the outer layer of skin, however if substances that emit alpha particles enter the bloodstream they are very poisonous. Inhaling dust containing such elements can cause serious lung damage or lung cancer.One of the most common sources of alpha particles is Radon Gas. This is invisible, odorless and colorless gas. Tiny amounts are given off slowly by uranium containing minerals in some areas. Because it's produced6) cosmic rays.This is a catch-all term for Ionizing radiation with high energy, that comes from space.These can be very high energy gamma rays, electrons, neutrons, protons, and sometimes unstable subatomic particles called muons. While the atmosphere blocks most of these, some reaches the Earth's surface and this is probably the most common sources of Natural Background Radiation.  Radon, which I previously mentioned, is another.Can you feel the radiation?Generally not. However it's very easy to detect with electronic equipment.Some people have reported tingling or burning sensations in the limbs and face, a metallic taste in the mouth, visual disturbances, or an odor like bleach or burning metal. However this has generally occurred at lethal levels of radiation and people who reported such symptoms tended to die days it weeks later.In a pitch dark room, highly radioactive objects will emit a faint blue glow due to ionization of the air around them. However this would indicate an object that is dangerously radioactive. Would not recommend.Radioactive items will also produce a blue glow underwater due to a different mechanism, called the Cherenkov Effect."}]}, {"question": "ELI5: What does \u201eStar collapses under its own gravity\u201d really mean when Star dies?", "author_name": "Copywithoutexample", "date": "23/02/20", "flair": "Physics", "answers": [{"date": "19/02/20", "score": 6, "text": "The fusion that\u2019s being going on the whole life of the start causing a large sustained nuclear explosion has been pushing against the stars gravity for however many millions of years in more or less a state of balance.Eventually the star will burn through enough fuel that it starts fusing stuff into iron.

Doesn't necessarily have to be tip, though."}, {"date": "05/02/20", "score": 6, "text": "if you whip it goodI do appreciate the Devo reference!"}, {"date": "05/02/20", "score": 6, "text": "Leverage. You arm moves 4 feet in an arc. The end of the whip travels 14+ or so in the same time frame. More distance traveled in the same period of time=exponential increase of speed."}, {"date": "05/02/20", "score": 3, "text": "Did you ever notice that hitting a ball with a heavier object, like a baseball bat, gives the ball much more speed than the bat itself? That is because the force between ball and bat speeds up the lightweight ball much more than it slows down the heavy bat itself.A whip uses a similar principle: If you swing the whip in the right way, the force of your hands at the grip is passed down its length in a wave. Now because the whip gets thinner (and lighter) towards its tip, the same force will act on a thinner and thinner rope, resulting in higher and higher speed. This gives the thin tip of the whip its ability to reach supersonic speed.Edit: Smarter Every Day made a video about this topic, where you can see this effect in slow-motion."}, {"date": "05/02/20", "score": 4, "text": "Another way of describing this is to look at a wave. The handle of the whip is large and heavy, so when you flick/throw the whip forward, the wave starts at the largest and heaviest part of the whip. As the energy is moving forward, the whip gets thinner and needs less energy to move it at the same speed, but because the energy is there it will make it go faster.Same thing as you see on the water, a wave in the middle of the ocean will only make little peaks and valleys, but once it reaches the shore, it will lift the small amount of water it there and let us surf on it."}, {"date": "05/02/20", "score": 0, "text": "The base ball and the bat example is conservation of momentum in a collision.It has nothing to do with force acting on a thinner surface area.  The end of a whip moves faster because of leverage (as someone else pointed out). The thinner end probably helps with air drag but the leverage is the predominant factor (a think but short piece of string doesn't have the same effect)."}]}]
