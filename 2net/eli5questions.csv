0,"Whoever said that is wrong.The FDA and IWBA can't find any evidence that age matters to plastic water bottles. The FDA has ruled that there is no limit to the shelf life of bottled water, and no company has even insinuated that the expiration is related to the plastic.In 1987, New Jersey passed a law requiring all bottles of water to be stamped with an expiration date 2 years after the bottling date. Since you can't identify which bottles will wind up shipped to NJ, companies just stamped all bottles with a 2-year expiration to ensure compliance.They never passed that law for Honey, which is why plastic honey bottles don't have an expiration.Although the law was repealed in 2006, companies had figured out people will throw out ""expired"" water and buy more, it actually increases sales, so they kept printing it ""voluntarily"".",14100.0,Chemistry

28,"chocolate milk has emulsifiers to keep it mixed that prevents the oreo from soaking up the milk in the same way. If you use nesquick, it does not have emulsifiers, and should not have a similar milk absorbance to store-bought chocky milkEDIT: I'm gonna add a few more notes after seeing the comments below. note - I'm from the US so if milk is different in different countries than I apologize, but this is true for the US.1: Why doesn't regular milk need emulsified?when you buy milk from the store its pasteurized and homogenized.The pasteurization kills bacteria to keep the milk safe to drink.The homogenization takes the milk fat globules and reduces them in size and to be uniformly dispersed through the rest of the milk. Without this process, the milk would separate.2: Why and what are emulsifersChocolate milk has emulsifiers. These are chemicals that keep the chocolate in the milk evenly mixed and prevent settling of be chocolate. This is why store bought chocolate milk taste better because emulsifiers are fatty and delicious but not healthy so people would rather mix healthier chocolate powderThe emulsifiers will combine with the milk particles to make bigger combinations of molecules. This is not a chemical reaction, but caused by the polarities of molecules bringing them together and keeping them mixed up well. This bigger molecules will not go into the oreo, as the milk is not easy to get away from its surrounded molecules, and the emulsifiers to do permeate the cookie. These emulsifiers will also raise surface tension which makes it harder for the milk to permeate the cookie.The egg used when baking is an emulsifer to get everything to mix together when they normally wouldn't want to.I don't know how to type it on reddit but this is where you would have likeFe2S03 DOT 6H20, where the molecule has 6 water molecules around it, but they aren't chemically combined.3: Why is store bought chocolate milk emulsified when homemade chocolate milk is not Premade chocolate milk needs to be emulsified because its shipped, kept in stores, and not drank all at once at your house.Regular milk doesn't need emulsified because its homogenized which is a different chemical process that keeps the milk particles suspended.Homemade chocolate milk will settle if it sits on your counter for a long time. This doesn't matter that much since you just make one cup at a time.4: Explain this to a five year old Chocolate milk from the store is milk with chocolate. Chocolate and milk are different so if they sit in the same container for a long time, the chocolate will fall to the bottom. That's why homemade chocolate milk will separate into a layer of chocolate at the bottom and milk at the top if you let it sit out for a long time.  Store bought chocolate milk needs to stay mixed because people don't want to buy chocolate milk if its separated. Since storebought chocolate milk is manufactured, shipped to a store, held there, purchased, brought home, and drank later, it needs to stay mixed for days or weeks.  This can be done using chemicals that keep the chocolate mixed evenly in the milk. These chemicals are tasty, but not healthy, and called emulsifiers. These will keep the chocolate mixed up for a long time. Regular milk doesn't need this because homogenization is an action done to milk to keep it mixed evenly. Homogenization means making the whole gallon uniform.",6900.0,Chemistry

31,"Master student food physics here. I don't know if emulsifiers have anything to do with this phenomenon, but I do know that there are some factual inconsistencies in this story.Let's start with an emulsion. An emulsion is a mixture of two or more immiscible liquids - for example oil and water. One is called the continuous phase, the other the dispersed phase. Milk for example is an emulsion of fat droplets in water, where the fat is the dispersed phase and water the continuous phase. You could also have an emulsion of water droplets (dispersed phase) in a continuous oil phase.Any mixture of fat and water will show phase separation, because they are immiscible and it is thermodynamically unfavourable to have a large interfacial area (the area where oil and water touch) between the two liquids. So what you see when you mix pure oil with pure water is that the two phases will separate very quickly, also if you homogenize the mixture. There is an interfacial tension between the two liquids that causes this. Luckily, nature found a way to prevent this phenomenon by using a molecule that can 'link' the two phases. Those molecules are called emulsifiers and they lower (not increase) the interfacial tension. Proteins, for example, can be emulsifiers. Also synthetic molecules can be emulsifiers, as long as they interact with both the oil and the water. Milk does not show phase separation (at least, very slow that is) because the proteins in milk keep this from happening. The very small fat droplets are covered by proteins, so that droplets repel each other, cannot merge, and therefore do not form one big fat layer on top of your milk. However, if you let your milk stand for a year (without any evaporation of the water) you will see a fat layer forming. Mixtures of immiscible fluids are always an unfavourable state to be in, so they will eventually show phase separation.Just like normal milk, chocolate milk has emulsifiers in there to 'stabilize' the interface between the water and chocolate fat droplets. Liquid chocolate milk usually does not contain additional emulsifiers, because skimmed milk is enriched with cocoa fat and the free proteins in the milk will act as emulsifiers for the added fat. Chocolate milk powder, such as Nesquick, usually contains lecithin, which is a molecule in egg yolk. You also use this emulsifier when making mayonnaise. The ingredients for mayonnaise are: water, oil, vinegar and egg yolks. Without the egg yolks, your mayonnaise will very rapidly show two separate layers: one oil layer and one water and vinegar layer.Emulsifiers are only needed in very very low quantities, so therefore they do not significantly influence the taste of products. It is also not true that they taste fatty per se. Proteins can be emulsifiers and they are usually not perceived to be fatty.What is the reason for the phenomenon you describe, I don't know. It could have to do with the higher viscosity of chocolate milk or a lot of other things. But it is not directly caused by the use of different emulsifiers.TL;DR: emulsifiers link immiscible liquids and can make them appear miscible for a long time, while every mixture of oil and water will separate eventually. Milk contains proteins that act as emulsifier and chocolate milk contains those proteins and/or lecithin, a compound in egg yolk. Emulsifiers are not the cause of the phenomenon that OP describes.",22.0,Chemistry

41,"70% alcohol has 30% water, and that water is necessary for the alcohol to interact at all with the cells it’s killing.It’s like cooking pancakes. You know how when your pan is really hot and you put in pancake batter, it cooks the outside really fast? And then you can flip it, but it does the same thing to the other side and the middle doesn’t cook very well? 90% alcohol is like that. It doesn’t penetrate well into cells or clumps of microbes because it just fries everything it touches on the outside. The 70% alcohol is like cooking on medium heat with a moderately hot pan. It contacts the outside, too, but the water helps it penetrate to cook the inside (denature proteins deeper) as well.From https://blog.gotopac.com/2017/05/15/why-is-70-isopropyl-alcohol-ipa-a-better-disinfectant-than-99-isopropanol-and-what-is-ipa-used-for/The presence of water is a crucial factor in destroying or inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microorganisms with isopropyl alcohol. Water acts as a catalyst and plays a key role in denaturing the proteins of vegetative cell membranes. 70% IPA solutions penetrate the cell wall more completely which permeates the entire cell, coagulates all proteins, and therefore the microorganism dies. Extra water content slows evaporation, therefore increasing surface contact time and enhancing effectiveness. Isopropyl alcohol concentrations over 91% coagulate proteins instantly. Consequently, a protective layer is created which protects other proteins from further coagulation.Solutions > 91% IPA may kill some bacteria, but require longer contact times for disinfection, and enable spores to lie in a dormant state without being killed. A 50% isopropyl alcohol solution kills Staphylococcus Aureus in less than 10 seconds (pg. 238), yet a 90% solution with a contact time of over two hours is ineffective.Edit: Because there’s been some confusion, I’d like to add two points. First, higher concentrations of alcohol solutions (specifically isopropyl) may still be superior as solvents, for use on things like electronics for cleaning, because water is generally bad for electronics. Second, what we’re talking about above you should think of as referring only to ethanol and isopropyl alcohol (which is not safe to consume). There are other alcohols but we’re just sticking to the ones commonly used.Edit 2: Some people have questioned the source, which is good and part of science. The source offered a decent write-up of what numerous PhD mentors have taught me, and it’s consistent with the science. At the risk of making this too long, here’s what the CDC has to say, from https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/disinfection/disinfection-methods/chemical.htmlAdding water enhances effectiveness of isopropyl and ethyl alcohols:The most feasible explanation for the antimicrobial action of alcohol is denaturation of proteins. This mechanism is supported by the observation that absolute ethyl alcohol, a dehydrating agent, is less bactericidal than mixtures of alcohol and water because proteins are denatured more quickly in the presence of waterIsopropanol and ethanol effective bactericidesThe bactericidal activity of various concentrations of ethyl alcohol (ethanol) was examined against a variety of microorganisms in exposure periods ranging from 10 seconds to 1 hour 483. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was killed in 10 seconds by all concentrations of ethanol from 30% to 100% (v/v), and Serratia marcescens, E, coli and Salmonella typhosa were killed in 10 seconds by all concentrations of ethanol from 40% to 100%. The gram-positive organisms Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were slightly more resistant, being killed in 10 seconds by ethyl alcohol concentrations of 60%–95%. Isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol) was slightly more bactericidal than ethyl alcohol for E. coli and S. aureus 489.Kills viruses at these concentrationsEthyl alcohol, at concentrations of 60%–80%, is a potent virucidal agent inactivating all of the lipophilic viruses (e.g., herpes, vaccinia, and influenza virus) and many hydrophilic viruses (e.g., adenovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, and rotaviruses but not hepatitis A virus (HAV) 58 or poliovirus) 49.Isopropanol similar to chlorhexidine https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0195670183900257",18100.0,Chemistry

However, if there are slight (microscopic) impurities, these can disturb the system just enough to lower the energy for the phase change.If you have very pure water and keep adding heat uniformly (such as a microwave), everywhere in the solution has the same energy and no one area preferentially wants to become the first bubble site.If you have a supersaturated sugar solution, it wants to crystallize because it is too saturated but no one area preferentially wants to form that first seed crystal.You can help such a system by disturbing it and giving it that first area that is slightly different where the phase change can start.  After that, the disturbance spreads as bubbles form or sugar crystals form.How can I fix my cookware to prevent this or why don’t manufacturers do something about this?Usually, you shouldn’t have to force this disturbance.  Your cooking pot, beer glass or mixing bowl already has micro scratches on the surface.  Boiling, carbonation bubbles or sugar crystals all start on these without help, most of the time.If you want to control where your water boils, in an attempt prevent boil overs, cookware companies make ceramic “pot minders” that cause most/all of the bubbles to form on the surface of the ceramic, instead of across the whole bottom of the pot.Some beer and sparkling wine companies make glasses with intentional etching on them.  This causes most of the carbonation bubbles to form in a certain pleasing place and stream to the top, instead of forming randomly all over the inside of the glass like you see in Sprite ads.Is this the same thing that causes rapid freezing when you touch a water bottle you forgot in your car in the cold?Yes.  The water was ready to freeze, it just needed a small disturbance to break the stalemate of where the first ice crystal would form.Is this the same thing that causes mugs of microwaved water to becomes traps for the unwary when they go to add powdered coffee or teabags?Yes.  The water was ready to boil, it just needed a small disturbance to break the stalemate of where the first bubble would form.ELI4Your water is ready to become steam, but it needs a little push to help it over the finish line.You can help either the most energetic water (closest to the stove) or all of the water if it is all ready (microwaved water) to become steam by giving it an easy place to start the change from.",6600.0,Chemistry

123,"First let's talk a little about what charcoal is -- charcoal is when you take wood and you heat it up without oxygen being around. The lack of oxygen is important because you don't want the wood to burn, you want to remove the water and other chemicals from the wood and leave behind the carbon. This oxygen-less heating process is called pyrolysis.Activated charcoal or activated carbon is charcoal that has been treated to create lots of small holes/pores within the structure of the charcoal. These microscopic holes increase the surface area. This gives the activated carbon more area to bind to things and lock them up, which is why activated carbon is useful for purification purposes. Different chemicals bind to activated carbon better or worse than one another, and you can change those properties by treating/modifying the activated carbon in different ways.You can make activated carbon using chemical activation using acids/strong bases/salts or physical activation with hot gases during pyrolysis.",7300.0,Chemistry

133,"@ u/YahyaJ the ""purification"" is meant chemically. So-called ""detox"" with the human (and in fact any other living being) body is extremely dangerous. Due to the huuuuuuuge surface area (comparison in another comment from another commenter; our teacher compared it to a ""amll round head of a pin"" should equal about a soccer field), it really absorbs a lot of chemicals. And while detox often says it ""removes impurities"" (whatever ""impurities"" really are), it does remove a lot of different chemicals, but without distinction. So it absorbs any vitamins, amino-acids, healthy fats, whatever you need just as well as useless stuff that your body would flush out anyways. It is especially dangerous if you are taking medicine and activated charcoal at the same time, as the charcoal can absorb those chemicals as well and thus prohibit the medicine from taking effect.What activated charcoal can be used for is diarrhea. But here you should still use small amounts and slowly increase the dosage if the small amounts don't help.

146,"Very interesting.  So, now I'm curious about second-hand smoke.  I'm not a smoker myself, and I've always tried to avoid staying near smokers too long for fear of complications from second-hand smoke.  But I've never been particularly concerned about staying near a bonfire for hours on end (not that I hang out near bonfires that often, but you know what I mean.)If I keep a group of smokers at about the same distance I would keep a bonfire (say 5-ish feet?), am I significantly reducing the risks associated with second-hand smoke?  Or is the idea that second-hand smoke is dangerous mostly BS, too?Or, should I perhaps start putting more distance between myself and any bonfires I come across?",9.0,Chemistry

167,"Electronic devices have energy stored in a battery that's restricted in where it can go by the location of wires.  When you add water, electric current can take other paths.  Some paths go through components that were designed to be protected from direct battery current by resistors.  When those protections are bypassed, the components can be exposed to more current than they can carry, causing permanent damage to them.",210.0,Chemistry
168,"This is a problem with all electronics, not just battery powered devices! Short circuits are bad, basically it allows ""infinite"" current to pass which causes heat accumulation which breaks down capacitors/resistors/microprocessors.Water also can cause corrosion which can ultimately ruin a device even if it seems initially ubscathed.",40.0,Chemistry
169,"So basically you can soak a device that's turned off, dry it, turn it on and it should be fine?",9.0,Chemistry
171,"There are 2 main reasons why water is bad for electronics.Corrosion through bi-metalic leeching and electrolysis. This includes the physical decomposition of metals but it also includes the deposit of new metal which can cause short circuits.Changing capacitance and affecting the flow of electrons.Pure water is not very conductive and in a pure environment it would not cause much damage if any. However in the real world the water is seldom pure and these impurities make the water conductive.Conductive liquid covering your circuits can change the capacitance of components which destabilizes the circuit and it can even lead to damage. It can also cause electrons to bridge a gap between two points it wasn't designed for if they are close enough together, the water is conductive enough, and the voltage potential is high enough. Thus current can move through a circuit in a way it wasn't designed for and damage it. These are the reasons why it's bad to try to turn on a wet device, and why a device which is powered off can get wet and be dried out later without failing.In addition, there are the corrosive effects. Water causes rust and oxidation, particularly in iron compounds like chokes, inductors, and transformers. There is also electrolysis to contend with. When you put 2 different metals in a conductive solution, ions can flow from one to the other which causes material to be deposited at one end, and corroded from the other. The material deposited may short circuit the tiny legs of integrated circuits, it may rapidly corrode other components which can lead to shorts and breaks.Remember how tiny everything is now days and how delicate the little metal legs and traces are that connect chips to each other. It only takes a few seconds of corrosion to dissolve part of a trace or short circuit 2 tiny wires thinner than a human hair.Even if the device is powered down, if it is left wet long enough it can still corrode due to the difference in potential between different metals, a bit like how a battery works.",28.0,Chemistry
172,"This is a pretty good eli5, but I feel it could be simplified.Electronics depend on electricity going where we want it to go.  Unless it's VERY pure water will act as a conductor causing it to go places it shouldn't.  This can cause it to behave wrong, which can lead to the components getting overloaded and permanently breaking.Water will likely corrode the electronics.  If it's not too bad it may still work, especially if an expert cleans it.  If it's bad enough in order to fix it you usually need to replace it (again, you need an expert for this).",9.0,Chemistry
173,Thanks!,2.0,Chemistry
175,"Well, it's not actually the water that's the problem.  If you had distilled water it may hurt some electronics, but many it would not because it isn't very conductive.  It's the imperfections, heavy metals, etc etc suspended in the water that cause the problem as they conduct electricity.@keyframes _2bkYZH_kJx5pIHW0Ts5P6e{0%{opacity:0}to{opacity:1}}._2uSuNRa3OeptFDJCKQ3vU6{position:absolute;border-radius:4px;animation:_2bkYZH_kJx5pIHW0Ts5P6e .5s step-end;white-space:pre-wrap;z-index:100;box-shadow:0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,.25);background:var(--newCommunityTheme-body);--contentTooltip-caretColor:var(--newCommunityTheme-body);--contentTooltip-leftMargin:0}._2uSuNRa3OeptFDJCKQ3vU6:after{position:absolute;line-height:6px;transform:scaleY(.7);margin-left:var(--contentTooltip-leftMargin);color:var(--contentTooltip-caretColor)}._2uSuNRa3OeptFDJCKQ3vU6._1rF-A55THyDL-rQ9ZUDQ4_{margin-top:-6px;--contentTooltip-leftMargin:-7px}._2uSuNRa3OeptFDJCKQ3vU6._1rF-A55THyDL-rQ9ZUDQ4_:after{top:100%;content:""\25BC"";text-shadow:0 4px 4px rgba(0,0,0,.25);left:50%}._2uSuNRa3OeptFDJCKQ3vU6._1MHCyMQAMeqRqf5DPWWeq3{margin-top:6px;--contentTooltip-leftMargin:-7px}._2uSuNRa3OeptFDJCKQ3vU6._1MHCyMQAMeqRqf5DPWWeq3:after{content:""\25B2"";top:auto;bottom:100%;text-shadow:0 -4px 4px rgba(0,0,0,.1);left:50%}._2uSuNRa3OeptFDJCKQ3vU6.nVD-oexLbZI_4QjhrkLFz{margin-left:6px}._2uSuNRa3OeptFDJCKQ3vU6.nVD-oexLbZI_4QjhrkLFz:after{content:""\25C0"";left:-12px;top:50%;text-shadow:-4px 0 4px rgba(0,0,0,.25)}._2uSuNRa3OeptFDJCKQ3vU6.KRVDnoE1RIC5qyqQLXxGG{margin-left:-6px}._2uSuNRa3OeptFDJCKQ3vU6.KRVDnoE1RIC5qyqQLXxGG:after{content:""\25B6"";left:calc(100% - 2px);top:calc(50% - 2px);text-shadow:4px 0 4px rgba(0,0,0,.25)}

/*# sourceMappingURL=IdCard.85bee69f2f559267015c.css.map*/If you think about a car battery (just picking a super large thing everyone is familiar with) the water and things inside it will connect the + and the - ports causing a short.

178,"Electronics work because the elecricity follows the conductive metal in specific ways to do what we want. Water is conductive, so it makes the elecricity go where we don’t want it.This alone doesn’t necessarily kill a device. If you open up your device and dry it thoroughly, then there is actually a chance you can get it to work again.But, if the device was on when it got wet, there is a chance the water could have made electricity go where it wasn’t supposed to go while the device was doing something important, which could cause an error on the coding or functioning of the device.Also, water is corrosive. If your device gets wet, and you don’t do a good job of drying it, it will cause a lot of the wires in your device to corrode, especially around things that store a lot of energy (like batteries or capacitors). Oftentimes, corrosion is not conductive, so any corroded wires essentially cut off the conductive wires.",2.0,Chemistry
186,"“When you spray Febreze, the water in the product partially dissolves the odor, allowing it to form a complex inside the ""hole"" of the cyclodextrin doughnut shape.

Depending on the type of Febreze you're using, the odor might simply be deactivated or it might be replaced with something nice-smelling, such as a fruity or floral fragrance.” - More here .",718.0,Chemistry

200,"Sorta- It worked so well that people didn't use it a 2nd time. They added the smell, which wears off faster than the fabreeze's effectiveness.

201,"This ""decomposition"" is really oxidation. Think of the oxidation like ""eating"". Aluminum is like a hamburger so it's really really easy to oxidize, so easy in fact that if other metals weren't added to it, the can wouldn't make it out of the factory. Other things are added to keep it from being ""eaten"" so quickly. Plastics on the other hand are very complex molecules that are very hard to eat. They're big like a huge bowl of jellybeans but also complex, like each one is in it's own wrapper that's really hard to open, so oxidizing plastic is very hard. This is partly by design so that the plastic will last. We can make Plastics that are easy to decompose. Compostable plastics are available, do a Google search for them.",7800.0,Chemistry

204,"We can make Plastics that are easy to decompose. Compostable plastics are available, do a Google search for them.Compostable plastics are widely misunderstood because most of them don't break down like people might expect. Lots of bioplastics are labeled as compostable because they're made from corn or sugar, but they usually have a higher carbon footprint during production due to land and fertilizer needed to produce the materials. They also can't just be thrown away because after ending up in a landfill, almost nothing degrades at all due to lack of air and moisture. Even if properly disposed of, they would most likely require a high-temperature industrial composting facility to break down, of which there are only 200 in the US.https://phys.org/news/2017-12-truth-bioplastics.amphttps://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/8954844/amp",90.0,Chemistry

For that reason, some people with a defective gene coding for a related enzyme are unable to break down fructose and are “fruit intolerant”.The more common version of this is the inability to break down lactose (sugar in dairy), aka lactose intolerance. This one is intentional though, since most mammals stop drinking milk after infancy.As stated above lactose breaks down to glucose and galactose. The glucose is no problem, but the galactose has to be converted to glucose before it can be broken down, and that process requires energy (making the energy you get from the sugar less efficient). The production of one specific enzyme (lactase) is naturally shut off after infancy (or later depending on genetic and dietary factors) to help be the most energy efficient when digesting food.Luckily because the cause for lactose intolerance is well known and consistent across most people, you can buy over-the-counter supplement pills (like lactaid) that have the enzyme your body no longer makes.

To do that, the spare electricity from cheap nuclear overnight is used to pump the hydro plants water back uphill, or if there's a surge in demand (kettles going on at half-time in the football), the hydro plant can be brought online at almost no notice to cover a surge.

258,"Others have described how a utility estimates demand for a day, and makes sure they have enough spinning capacity, or purchase arrangements to handle it.On the minute by minute power generation side, that is an area I have designed the control systems for.In the power grid each utility has a control area they are responsible for power regulation - in other words supplying enough power on an instantaneous basis to meet the customer demand. That control area is connected to other control area by power lines called tie lines. Each control area may buy or sell power over those tie lines. There is an assumption that the rest of the grid outside of the tie lines is infinite, or nearly. Meaning it can either absorb over generation, or make up for under generation in the control area.Assume for a moment the control area is not buying or selling power. If the control area is generating exactly what the users demand, the net flow over the tie lines will be zero. So from a real time power control standpoint the computers in the control area monitor the net power flow on the tie lines (called the area control error). If power is flowing into the control area, then that means the supply is less than demand, and the computers will bump up the output of certain generators in the system based on economics and their ability to regulate. And the opposite is true if over generating. In the systems I worked on this was done every 4 seconds.Of course the grid is not infinite in real life. If every control area on the grid was under generating, they would all be quite happy with their area control error, but the grid frequency would drop. So each control area also monitors the grid frequency and adjusts their generating output based on a grid agreed on bias. So if say the net power flow into the control area was zero, but the grid frequency was below spec, the control system would bump up the output of its generators, and vice versa.",2.0,Chemistry
259,"Powerplants try to produce exactly the amount of power which is required. Because if they produce to little, our appliances won't work, if they produce to much, our appliances will fry :). The power grid has a constant frequency of 50 or 60 Hz, depending on where you live. The generators in a power plant run at a certain speed to maintain that exact frequency and all power plants are in sync. However, if we start using more power than they are producing, the frequency will drop slightly, to 49.9 for example. This is a trigger for the power plant that they are not producing enough, and they will then turn up the gas a bit, increase their production and try to get it back to 50 Hz. If we use less than they are producing, the frequency goes up a bit, to 50.1 for example. This triggers them to reduce power.Different types of power plants have different reactiontimes, a gas plant can increase or decrease production very vast, coal takes more time (minutes, hours), nuclear even more (hours, days) and some we can't really control, like solar and wind, those we can only disconnect from the grid if we want to reduce their production.Overal the power companies will forecast how much they expect to be needed to be produced. This is done based on historical data, weather forecasts and trading of electricity. For example on a hot summerday they expect more power to be required for airconditioning. And large (industrial) power consumers need to tell the power company what they are going to use the next day (sometimes up until hourly or even smaller time frames) they call this nomination. All this information gives a pretty good estimate how much power needs to be available at which part of the day, that information is also constantly updated and used to set the base production of electricity. (which plant is on, at which percentage, what is kept as backup, which one can shut down for maintenance etc.)There are ways to store electricity produced by a gas plant by the way, but storing it is inefficient or expensive. So it is more economical to just turn down the gas a bit when the electricity is not required.",8.0,Chemistry

But to do it on a scale of big power plants would take billions of dollars and millions more to maintain.  That's why we don't do it on really big scales.This holds true for all big power plants - not just gas plants.  You could say that how we produce the power doesn't really matter.Now for your next question about how much they produce... they guess.  Really, they just guess.  It's a well informed guess, though.  They go by how much power was produced at that time yesterday, every day of the week, month, year, etc..  They also consider special events and occasions happening in the area, and compare them to similar events and occasions in the past.  The math can get pretty complicated, as they consider all these things.  But in the end, it's an estimation; a guess.  But they've come to be pretty good at guessing.And when their guess is not quite right, then they ""borrow"" power from nearby plants, or they ""lend"" some power.  So if one power plant underestimated, they can get some from a nearby plant that overestimated.  And vise versa.Where does the wasted energy go?  It is wasted - unused.  It's like the unused processing power of your computer.  You can't collect it for later.  Electricity is mostly a ""use it or lose it"" proposition.

As an enzyme, catalase helps make certain chemical reactions occur. Specifically, catalase’s job is to detoxify the hydrogen peroxide that cells make. It does this by splitting hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.Because the chemical production of hydrogen peroxide as a waste product occurs in basically all living things, basically all living things have catalase inside them.

333,"It has to do with the amount of air pockets in the substance and the heat capacity of air.Air has a fairly low heat capacity, meaning it doesn’t take a lot of energy to lower or raise its temperature.Things like blankets are made of materials that have lots of air pockets. The fuzz or lining or batting fibers interlock and form these pockets. The blanket starts at room temperature, but when you use it to cover yourself your body heat becomes trapped by these air pockets and then warms them up, and the blanket may begin to feel warm to the touch.Rocks, on the other hand, have relatively few air pockets, if any. They are very dense, and the heat capacity for most rocks is very high, meaning that it takes a lot of energy to change their temperature. The rocks start out at room temperature, just like the blanket. If you were to cover up with them, or perhaps build a house out of the rocks, it would take a lot of energy to heat it up. However, once the rocks got warm, it would also take a lot of energy to cool them off again, so it would stay warm longer than the blankets would after you stopped adding heat through your body heat or maybe a fireplace.Additionally, the reason that rocks feel cooler when you first touch them has to do with relative body heat. Things that are at lower temperatures than your body feel cool, things that are higher feel hot. A room temperature rock will feel cooler than your 98.6 F body.  But, blankets are made of fibers and air pockets so while they also feel cool at first, the friction between your skin and the fibers generates heat quickly and heats up the air pockets, making the blanket feel warm much more quickly than the rock.

However, when hydrogen forms an ionic bond with something it loses it’s only proton and essentially becomes only an electron and that electron can be used in an electron beam to shoot at things. Also electrons behave like solid particles and light waves, so each time it’ll behave differently when it’s shot at something.Edit Thanks to every person who corrected me, I understand I was wrong",-2.0,Chemistry

377,"As a cosmetic hobbyist, I can explain this very simply. Alcohols do different things. And generally, cosmetic ingredients tend to have more than one effect.Cetyl Alcohol: Stabilizes the emulsions. It has humectant(the skin will stay hydrated) properties. It also makes the cosmetic opaque. You can add oils and fats instead of cetyl alcohol, but the ingredient wouldn't be stable. It would be hard in Canada, more creamy in Turkey.Cetearyl Alcohol: Similar to cetyl alcohol. But has different texture in cosmetics.Ethyl Alcohol: Mostly used in perfumes and body mists. It's a solvent. Makes perfume smell more powerful. Used as a preservative if it's added a lot of amounts.Glycerine: Humectant, and used as a solvent when you make plant extracts. Cosmetics have a lot of extracts, so they may use this as a solvent. Also used when you make transparent soap. And boosts the preservative effect. Glycerine is a preservative like sugar, but you have to use it a lot of amounts. I mean, A LOT OF.Propylene Glycol: Somehow, Lush loves this ingredient. It's also like glycerine, but this feels more synthetic. I tend to use glycerine in my cosmetics and extracts. Also, this ingredient heavily used as a solvent of aroma chemicals.Xylitol: Used in toothpaste as bacteria killer and sweetener. I love this ingredient so much. You can even make a candy that cleans your teeth with this.Isopropyl alcohol: Never used this, but B&BW uses this in their body scrubs. I think it has some ""scrubbing"" properties.",151.0,Chemistry

396,I mean it would taste really fishy but there could be some application for it in cooking lol,2.0,Chemistry
397,Okay so let's take the most commonly used oil in  fish oil pills which is cod liver oil. It goes rancid Superfast for one it's not exactly cheap to harvest compared to other oils and you don't need that much fish oil to have an effect on your diet,5.0,Chemistry
399,"Fish oil is ""good"" for you because it contains relatively high amounts of omega 3 fatty acids.However...It is not the only source of omega 3 fatty acids.  Other oils also contain omega 3 of similar structure, like canola oil.  Same with other vegetables.Lastly, it is not entirely clear how beneficial and in what amounts omega 3 are.",3.0,Chemistry
400,"There actually has been quite a bit of research about this; there's actually a prescription version of one of the components of fish oil (eicosapentaenoic acid) that's been determined to probably be the one that's most effective for cardiovascular health.Big study came out last year showing a 25% decrease in risk of cardiovascular events with the drug (in patients who had high fat levels in their blood, and most of whom who had already had heart problems). https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1812792[Disclaimer: I did contract work for the company that makes this drug but I don't at the moment, and I'm not 100% convinced by the study]",3.0,Chemistry
401,"As far as I’ve read the important part is the omega 3 to omega 6 ratio. Canola oil has an omega 6 to omega 3 ratio of 2:1 which would be okay if it was your only fatty acid source. Unfortunately most people eat a lot of sunflower, corn and soybean oil which are very high in omega 6. The idea behind omega 3 supplements is to balance this surplus.Blue (Omega 6) in this diagram is bad, orange (Omega 3) is good: http://i0.wp.com/images-prod.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/AN_images/node_128132_graphs/fatty-acid-breakdown-of-different-fats.jpg",3.0,Chemistry
402,"As others have stated, the omega 3 will break down in heat, thus removing most of the health benefits of fish oil. But also  :An important factor in cooking with oil, is where the smoke point is. This matters for both taste, and health (cancer risk!). You want to cook with oils lower than the temperature that they smoke at.Thats why you don't (or shouldn't) fry in olive oil, etc, but instead use peanut oil or other oils with a high smoke point.https://www.cancerschmancer.org/articles/healthiest-cooking-oil-comparison-chart-smoke-points-and-omega-3-fatty-acid-ratios",5.0,Chemistry
403,"Tasting in general works better when food is hot. This is why most food is eaten hot, and foods that are supposed to be eaten cold can taste weird when warm. (Have you ever eaten warm melted ice cream? It's sickeningly sweet, because when it's cold you don't taste it as much).",20.0,Chemistry
404,Ah ok that makes sense. So what’s the taste of hot water? Acidic?,5.0,Chemistry
405,"Cold water is generally an acquired taste and deviating from that can feel oddCold water prevents your taste buds from responding to any impurity in the water that you otherwise would have if the water was hot. Cold water is essentially a numbing agent to an extent.   By extension, taste buds are more sensitive when they are in a hotter environment.",17.0,Chemistry
408,"Oxygen makes water taste better, and the hotter the water is, the less oxygen that the water contains",2.0,Chemistry
409,Huh. TIL that oxygen influences water's flavor. I always thought that this was a temperature thing affecting the sensitivity of taste buds and/or releasing any dissolved volatile compounds.,5.0,Chemistry
410,So if u had a half full cold water bottle that was closed and there was a seal between the water and the air and then the air was turned into vacuum.So there is pure water at the bottom and vacuum at the top with a seal between them and the seal was opened. Would the vacuum be filled by pure oxygen? Or would there be hydrogen too? Would there be any other gases?,2.0,Chemistry
412,"As others have mentioned, bacteria has lipids (basically oil) on the outer layer of their cells, your hands also have oils, and bacteria can deposit on your hands with ease...The main issue is the fact that oil and water don't mix (you can try that at home, put oil in water, and they will be separate. You can mix that, and for a moment they will seem mixed, but leave them and they will separate).So, passing water over your hands to clean them won't do much. That's where soap comes in play! The structure of soap is basically a long chain (think like a beads necklace you can wear but open it up and lay it down) with atoms on one end which like water (hydrophilic) and atoms on the other hand that dislike water (hydrophobic).When you mix the soap on your hand, the end of the soap that dislike water (hence likes oils) tends to mingle and stick to the oils/bacteria on your hand. Then, when you pass water on them, the end of the soap that likes water, tends to stick to water, and since water is moving, it will drag the soap with it and the soap will drag the bacterial/oils away from your hand as you rinse.",6600.0,Chemistry

421,It isnt true that water alone won't do much. Washing with just water removes ~80% of bacteria from your hands. With soap takes that up to about 90-95%.,2.0,Chemistry
422,"Adding to this soap contains something(s) called a Surface Active Agent, frequently abbreviated to ""SurFactAnt"" in industry - as OP says this is what lifts oils, dirt & bacteria off of the skin but it also disrupts some/most bacterias cell membrane (what makes their insides not their outsides); and one definition of life is insides ≠ outsides.Alcohol gels and hand sanitizer does a similar thing, but using solvent to disrupt the cell wall interaction, it just doesn't work for all as some have different walls that are more resillient, hence why it's better to use soap.",2.0,Chemistry

/*# sourceMappingURL=IdCard.85bee69f2f559267015c.css.map*/In the last few years, the Permafrost in Siberia's Artic Shelf has been thawing out with global warming. This permafrost has been frozen for a very long time..thousands of years. Underneath it is untold masses of decayed plant and animal matter which contains copious amounts of Methane; a byproduct of decomposition. This process is self feeding, and will accelerate global temperatures as more thaws out. Bad news.",2.0,Chemistry
443,"This was one of the biggest reasons I switched to a plant based diet, even meatless Monday's and swapping dairy milk for oat or soy would cause a big drop in the annual production of methane if enough people did it.Meatless Monday's would be something around 1 - 2 less cows per person participating per year, depending on their normal diet. That'd be over 579 million less cows per year (for North America), or 57.4 million tons of Methane removed. Removing dairy milk would increase this number considerably as well, though that can be a harder adjustment period for people.",5.0,Chemistry
444,"Which is a massive oversimplification that exaggerates the effect of methane by considering a theoretical situation where the atmosphere is only methane vs only carbon dioxide.  In the real world it is a lot more complicated.The greenhouse effects of gases depend on their concentration and the wavelengths that they block.  Methane has a much lower concentration than carbon dioxide and blocks wavelength that overlap with the “real” greenhouse gas ... water vapor.  Therefore, the real world effect of methane is much less than the theoretical one.  Not 28x or 34x but only about 7x.Methane stays in the atmosphere for a much shorter period than carbon dioxide.  Therefore, unlike carbon dioxide it’s effect is not cumulative.  If the cattle population stays the same then there is no more warming effect.  So in any country with a stable or decreasing cattle population all of their methane contributes the equivalent of exactly zero tonnes of carbon dioxide.So a more accurate answer to OPs question is that the words are quite meaningless.As further background, the reason cattle produce methane is that they digest cellulose from plants.  If there were no cattle the plants would just be digested by microbes in the soil, and other animals, all producing methane.  So unless someone is planning to destroy all plant life along with the cattle methane is getting produced anyway.  You can debate how much may get trapped in soil and only released later but it doesn’t change that the ultimate source of the methane is plants.",2.0,Chemistry
452,"Whole wheat flour has all the parts of the grain ground up together, most notable is the bran (the outer covering). White flour has this sifted out and is just the endosperm. Cake flour has a high starch content and low protein so the result is crumbly. Bread flour has a high protein content so the result is chewy. All purpose flour has a balance between the starch and protein so you can use it for most recipes.",17.0,Chemistry
453,"Adding, whole wheat flour behaves very differently in baked goods than white flour. You need to have recipes written especially for them. You can make cake from whole wheat flour but it has a heavier, denser texture.",3.0,Chemistry
455,"Bread flour has higher gluten content. This makes a more stable dough and better rise. It also gives structure to the bread.Cake flour has low gluten content. Cakes don't need rise, more gluten can work against a very soft and moist cake.All purpose is just something in between bread and cake flours. It won't make the best breads consistently. Bread is probably more sensitive to gluten content.Whole grain etc is how much processing the grain has before being ground into flour. White flour tends to have the most processed (and bleached) while whole wheat a lot less. White flour keeps longer (since the fats have been removed) which is why they are popular.",8.0,Chemistry
456,"So I bake but I don’t know much about flour. Would you say I should be using bread flour instead of cake and pastry flour in scones? I typically keep cake and pastry around as I don’t bake bread, but my scones don’t seem to rise much and they’re heavier than I’d like.",2.0,Chemistry

458,"In white flour, the outer seed coat (the bran) and the germ or embryo are removed, leaving only the inner energy storage organ of the kernel, which is called the endosperm.This can generally be done by coarsely crushing the kernels with a series of rollers, and then sifting out the larger particles. If this process of crushing and sifting is repeated several times, nearly all of the endosperm is separated from the bran and germ.The endosperm is harder and more brittle than the germ and bran, so it shatters into smaller particles when crushed.Whole wheat flour is just that. The sifting/winnowing step is omitted and the entire kernel is further milled into finished flour with fine particles. There is usually a sifting step at the end to remove large fragments, but this is simply fed back into the mill at the beginning to be further broken down in size.White flour is considered to produce the best quality bread and cakes. Most of the fiber in wheat is contained in the bran and germ. Fiber interferes with the development of gluten in dough, producing a less chewy, elastic bread.Most of the oil is also contained in the bran and germ. This can slowly oxidize, causing the flour to become rancid or stale. Thus, white flour has a longer shelf life.However, most of the vitamins and minerals are contained in the germ and bran. So whole wheat flour is more nutritious. White flour in many countries is required by laws to be fortified with extra vitamins and minerals for this reason.  Whole wheat flour due to it's higher oil content, has more of a characteristic ""wheaty"" flavor, which some people like.Different types of four are classified by their protein content.Cake flour has the the lowest protein content and the highest starch content. Usually about 5-7%It's produced from certain low protein varieties of wheat, often described as ""soft"" referring to the fact that they produce a soft dough. Usually Soft Winter types. The terms ""Pastry flour"" and ""cake flour"" are sometimes used interchangeably, and these flours usually can be.  Cake flour with low protein results in small bubbles on rising and moist texture.Pastry flour is usually defined to have slightly higher protein than cake flour, around 6-9%. This is also usually made with soft winter types.This makes it easy to roll out into sheets, owing to limited stretch and gluten.""All purpose"" flower tends to be a grab bag. It's usually blended from several different wheat varieties with different protein content or ""hardness.""  Really, whatever is available to the mill that can produce the protein level they want. This produces a flour with about 10-12% protein. However hard winter wheat is the most common source, at least in the US. The climate in much of the Central and northern US tends to be ideal for winter wheat, which is planted in the fall and harvested early next summer.Despite this, I would not recommend using AP flour for yeast bread. It works reasonably well for baking powder breads like american biscuits/ and UK scones. However it's best to adulterate AP with cornstarch or rice flour in a 2:1 ratio, respectively, for the purpose of pastry and fine cakes.""Bread flour"" has the highest protein content, more than 13%. It's typically made from hard spring wheat varieties.In some stores you can also buy ""Durum"" aka Semolina flour, which is normally used to make pasta.This is made from a different species of wheat, Triticum durum vs common bread wheat which is Triticum aestivum. It tends to have a higher protein content, however much less is gluten forming proteins. This gives pasta made from it the characteristic chewy texture, but due to the lack of gluten it is easy to form into pasta shapes.Durum wheat also prefers hotter, drier weather, and a warmer, wetter winter, and a longer growing season, so it's grown in lower latitudes such as southern europe, and the middle East.",2.0,Chemistry

And because trace amounts of uranium are pretty much in every rock, there's thorium-230 in them as well. When this isotope decays, it turns into radon-226, which is a noble gas, which rises from the ground and mixes with air. This isotope in turn only lives for a few days, and decays into polonium - which is a solid and therefore falls back to the ground as dust.So even if a tobacco field is not fertilized with minerals containing trace uranium, some amount of radon gas will always be there, and with it polonium.",1500.0,Chemistry

If you inhale radioactive material then its stuck inside of you, bouncing around the material inside of you and not having anywhere to go.This is part of what makes nukes so immensely horrible.

Boiling helps by letting trapped gas and particles to escape, aiding in clarity. However air itself will reduce clarity, and can't entirely be boiled away. Because impurities arise at the end of the freezing process, they can be avoided by creating the ice in a container that is insulated on 5 of the 6 sides, leaving the top exposed. This results in something called directional freezing, where the water is forced to freeze down, pushing anything that would disrupt the clarity to the bottom.

But read the fine print; you can't just chuck 'em on your compost pile. They're biodegradable only in specialized industrial facilities. So, in order for them to not harm the environment, they need to be collected and processed properly. Which is more or less true of conventional plastics as well.

The triple bond between the two nitrogen atoms in N2 takes a LOT of energy to break and even if you do break it the energy released if it bonds with other elements is often less than the energy required to break up N2.

Instead of putting the water into a freezer and cooling it with air they spray/pour water directly on the coils of the freezer. This makes it form in a bunch of thin and quickly formed layers, instead of as one thick chunk which is frozen slowly over dozens of minutes.When ice is formed in a big chunk it freezes from the outside in. So a layer on the outside forms, and then the inside of it is stopped from expanding and can't push itself out, which makes a bunch of stress lines/fractures throughout the cube.

If you know exactly what chemicals create a scent, you can also create synthetic scents in a lab.

Usually alcohol. Alcohols evaporate fast so dabbing some on your skin won't leave a wet spot as the alcohol evaporates but leaves the scented oil.As for what makes a male or female perfume, that's really just psychology, stereotypes and a whole lot of marketing.Things like flowers, candy, cookies and other sweet things are often associated with women. And so their scents make a good basis for feminine products.Men are often idealised as tough, rugged, hard-working, adventurous and so on.

Many compounds that we recognize as characteristic smells are very similar to alcohol (esters).So by immersing animal materials, flower petals and other good smelling things in a bath of alcohol, we often can leech out these compounds because the compounds want to be in both the alcohol and the material until they are roughly equally in both. We call this process extraction.Making coffee is another form of extraction. Making decoffinated coffee beans is much fancier but follows very similar principles that I outlined here. Alike seeks alike in chemistry: we call the preference of one material to interact with another selectivity.Different compounds might need other solvents or other processes though.

688,"Corrosive reactions are reactions - two or more molecules encountering each other, thinking ""y'know what, let's become something else"" and then becoming something else. This happens because the end results of the reaction are a more preferable state to be in, thermodynamically. Let's take an example:Hydrochloric acid and sodium metal. In its normal state, sodium is just a bunch of sodium atoms all in one place. Hydrochloric acid is made by dissolving the covalent HCl molecule in water, creating a solution with a lot of charged hydrogen and charged Chlorine atoms (a charged molecule is loves to react with things, is probably the most you need to know about that). Normally, hydrogen and chlorine don't really like each other when they're in water together, so they disassociate, instead of remaining as HCl. They also don't like being alone, though, and can only hang out in their gaseous forms when they're stuck to another atom of the same element. However, because of how they share electrons, they can't do this. That's a really complicated thing though that I suspect you don't need to know about.Then, you drop some Sodium into the mix. Charged chlorine loves to stick to sodium, so every chlorine atom in the acid plucks one sodium atom off the sodium piece, forming sodium chloride. This moves some electrons around, and allows the hydrogen to float off as hydrogen gas (hence why this reaction fizzes). Sodium chloride meanwhile is an ionic compound (common table salt, in fact), which dissolves in water and which forms crystals, not metals. So, gradually, the size of the sodium piece gets smaller, because sodium is being ripped off to become sodium chloride, and the acid also becomes less acidic because the molecules that make it acidic are being turned into salts and gasses.The acidic property of acids comes from the fact that hydrogen atoms dissociate from their compounds while dissolved in water. Not all hydrogen-containing compounds do this, but the ones that do are called acids. The amount to which they dissociate (not all molecules will dissociate all the time, only a proportion of all the molecules) determines the strength of the acid.",33.0,Chemistry

The marbles will just sit there and make way for the magnets to clump up. A surfactant is a molecule made up of mostly marbles but has magnets at the end.

That way you can have little balls of marbles throughout the magnet soup.Now replace the magnets with water and the marbles with oil, dirt, or any number of things. That's how soaps work.

Fructose is a lot sweeter than glucose or sucrose, which means less of it is required to create the taste of sweetness. Many artificial sweeteners are fructose-based. Fructose is also less versatile than glucose in terms of what the body can use it for.The sugar in sweets is typically sucrose, as is raw white sugar. Sucrose is broken down into 1 glucose and 1 fructose in your small intestine. The glucose is subsequently stored in the liver, whilst the fructose behaves like fructose. Generally, you need more sucrose to create a flavour of sweetness than you do fructose, however, sucrose is also waaaaay easier to make and also quite a lot easier to work with, which is why it's the go to sugar for things like baking.The sugar in things like potatoes and meat tend to be glucose-based polysaccharides. In potatoes, this is starch. This kind of sugar you probably hear referred to most often as ""carbohydrates"". They're the carbohydrates that don't count as ""of which sugar"" on food labels. These sugars take quite a while for your digestive tract to digest, and are also very easily stored by the liver (the first stop of the blood after the small intestine, where glucose is absorbed), meaning that these large glucose-based polysaccharides are much less of an issue for blood sugar levels than sucrose is. Also, these polysaccharides don't taste sweet, which means they don't activate the brain's dopamine very much, and thus it's much harder to over-eat.Bonus round: Lactose sugars found in milk and other dairy products are even less sweet than glucose, but is pretty much identical to glucose in terms of function since the body rapidly converts it into glucose. However, most humans can't actually digest lactose at all.No sugar is directly worse for your health than any other. The real danger of sugar is that it can be addictive, and as a sweet substance, is also something we can be prone to eating far too much of just by accident. Sucrose in particular dissolves spectacularly well, so you can pack a ton of it into pretty much anything you want, like coke.",13.0,Chemistry

The fancy term for that is acellular carbohydrates, because they aren't packaged in cells the way the fructose from fruit and the glucose from potatoes comes. Your digestive system absorbs the acellular carbs in one massive hit as you eat them rather than over hours as your body breaks down the fibre around the sugars in other foods.So the 'bad' sugars are white sugar, things with white sugar in them, and sugary drinks.The 'good' sugars are ones which come inside wholefoods like fruit, potatoes etc etc.",2.0,Chemistry

This is supported by the fact that even people who aren't helped by antidepressants are helped by other things that help the brain build new structures, like exercise.

838,"It's because of something called capillary action. Wikipedia's description of the physics:Capillary penetration in porous media shares its dynamic mechanism with flow in hollow tubes, as both processes are resisted by viscous forces. Consequently, a common apparatus used to demonstrate the phenomenon is the capillary tube. When the lower end of a glass tube is placed in a liquid, such as water, a concave meniscus forms. Adhesion occurs between the fluid and the solid inner wall pulling the liquid column along until there is a sufficient mass of liquid for gravitational forces to overcome these intermolecular forces. The contact length (around the edge) between the top of the liquid column and the tube is proportional to the radius of the tube, while the weight of the liquid column is proportional to the square of the tube's radius. So, a narrow tube will draw a liquid column along further than a wider tube will, given that the inner water molecules cohere sufficiently to the outer ones.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary_actionSimplified:Liquids get sucked in to little holes with a force greater than gravity, and napkins are filled with lots of little holes.",8.0,Chemistry

So the colder the drink is initially, the larger the total amount of gas it can release.Notably, this isn’t a reversible process.

Now think of that cup of say, coke like a bunch of brown marbles with some white ones in it. Those marbles represent the particles of liquid and the white ones represent the gas. Now at that level those marbles are constantly vibrating and bouncing of each other. The more they vibrate the more energy the drink has and the hotter it is.A cold drink is only slightly vibrating. Those marbles barely move at all. So the dissolved white marbles can't make it to the surface and bounce out leaving more room for white marbles to be added without bouncing out at the top. In the same way the tiny particles of gas can't move and escape either. Now hot beverages are shaking a lot. There is a lot of movement. So those white marbles have a lot of opportunities to make it to the top and bounce out. Meaning less will be held in the liquidSo when you drink a cold beverage more of those dissolved gasses are already present in the liquid, and when it enters your mouth the liquid is shaken (much like a bottle of soda) and those gases form bubbles.

Ideally, the PSA will have a lower surface energy than the adherend, so that it wets spontaneously. Pressing down on the tape improves adhesion by rapidly putting the adhesive into more intimate contact with the surface. Once in contact, adhesion will continue to build naturally over time (about an hour). Pressure has no effect on the final bond except to increase the area of contact on rough surfaces.When the tape is peeled, the adhesive stretches and fibrillates before the bond ruptures.

As the can is sealed, the extra free CO2 molecules rattle around causing locally increased pressure in the air space and lower pressure in the liquid they left behind.

Seeing this escape rate change can tell us that there is a breach of some sort in the container, which is very helpful in pipelines and sealed circulation systems. This gas escaping happens all the time, even without shaking the bottle. But for the purposes of a bottle of soda, for example, this takes months or years to occur and notably make the drink go ""flat"" even before opening it.To everyone talking about pressure increasing when you shake a bottle, that is definitely not true and what you're instead thinking of for that foaming is nucleation sites created when you shake the bottle.

Chemistry works in a weird ways, for example, the same molecule can be either deadly or an effective drug to combat severe desease (enantiomers).Now, to explain why it is still used and how it is safe (kinda) think about table salt and gold production.Table salt (NaCl) is made of sodium (explosive when exposed to oxygen) and chlorine (deadly as pure gas). Together they make a lattice (cage-like structure) through bonds (almost polymer like), and salt is produced, which is safe to consume.Polyethylene is made of ethylene, which is toxic.

Eating foods that are hot in temperature (another trigger for these receptors/related thermal receptors) then is an additive effect for your overall sensation of sensing hot/increased temperature.

Some plants have developed chemicals that target TRPV1 to deter mammals from eating them (e.g. capsaicin from chili peppers).

If your warm air in your house touches the cold glass, it gets cold and falls. This brings more warm air in from above so it can get cold. You get basically a soft, invisible wind near your windows that makes it cool your house even faster. An important thing to know is that the bigger the difference in temperature between two things, the faster the warm one cools and the cool one warms. If the air by the glass wasn't moving, it would would cool down closer to the temperature of the cold glass and then the rest of the air couldn't cool so fast.",8.0,Other

If the role of a fort is to monitor an area, then being able to see more of the area being monitored is an advantage.Harder to attack. It is always harder to attack something that is above you. It requires more effort and energy, and you have a disadvantage in the operation and effectiveness of your weaponry. (This refers more to traditional, pre-20th century combat. Modern weaponry and materiel largely obviate much of this concern.)Your defenses are enhanced by gravity. The enemy has to make an extra effort to reach and attack your position, and their efforts are hampered by gravity. The fort has the opposite advantage: Anything you throw or shoot will be headed downwards, and thus require less effort on your part to reach the attackers.All of these advantages pertain to pre-modern concerns, obviously. Modern technology makes it possible to monitor huge areas from high mobile platforms, to easily and effectively attack from any angle, and also to defend from any angle. The traditional fort on the hill is a holdover from an earlier time, when different concerns had greater significance.What has not changed as much, however, is the strategic placement of forts or other such placements at or near critical natural choke points. A sea battery at the end of a narrow peninsula has advantageous command of a sweeping fire solution which might cover every bit of a body of water necessary for passage of large vessels, and thus effectively defend an entire seaway from a single point, so long as it is itself adequately defended from attack. A fort at the mouth of a narrow valley may effectively prevent passage of heavy convoys to the interior. And so on.",37.0,Other

The were armed with heavy artillery, and the range of that artillery was greater than the width of the river. So those forts were capable of reaching practically any enemy ship sailing up the river toward the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.  There was also at least one more fort on the opposite bank in Portsmouth, NH, and working together they provided a devastating cross-fire gauntlet for enemy ships to run.

The essence of “conventional forces” is that they are uniformed:  each side can spot the combatants and and as a rough tactical guideline those forces more or less avoid human and “cultural heritage” shields.The treaties are utterly inappropriate for modern warfare.  The modern soldier facing conventional forces intentionally uses tactics calculated to frustrate enemies concerned about war-crimes.  For example, placing an anti-air emplacement next to a mosque, housing resupply depots in hospitals and the like in areas they control.  In contested areas, the order of the day will be “insurgent” warfare—a method in every way designed to use the civilian population as a terrified human shield and form of camouflage.For example, Mexican drug cartels are terrorist organizations by any definition not tortured into a shape meant to exclude them specifically while still keeping ISIS in the Venn diagram.  The most likely reason the US has not declared them as terrorist organizations is the understanding that they would immediately launch a full scale insurgent war in the US.  The US, in turn, is both too morally weak and too constrained by war-crimes treaties to take the actions necessary both in the US and Mexico to put down the cartels permanently.The point of this is that the war-crimes concept needs revision and adaptation to an age where insurgency and terrorism is the norm of conflict and not the exception.

Often the dams and rainfall run low or may become inadequate. Also as catchments run low, quality of water lessens.Exclusive use of water for particular communities and damming upstream, can have dire effects downstream, creating humane and natural disasters effecting farming, livelihoods, animals and environments terribly.Water is needed for other social purposes (hospitals, fire fighting, key industries etc) as much as natural and personal use, to keep society functioning.In some places, that’s provided by building and operating desalination or reprocessing plants for seawater, industrial waste waters or sewage(London uses sewage) cost a huge amount of money to run.Where water availability is cheap geographically and climatically, and demand/waste is not as much, there is less cost.

Water is pumped out of the ground from an aquifer (porous underground rock filled with water) for human consumption. A small amount is evaporated while it makes the journey from faucet/spigot/toilet to your septic tank. Depending on the type of septic system, a majority of the water will likely make it into the ground; however it's unlikely to make it back to the aquifer. Plants and bacteria and such will also use some of that water; plants especially will use some of that water for evapotranspiration (which releases the water into the atmosphere to be carried off). As the aquifer has less and less water to replenish soil, the ground gets dryer and dryer. Also, depending on where you live, there is a small chance that the above-mentioned evaporated water makes it into the ocean and turns into seawater...which then might turn into freshwater rain (or not).All that said - your long showers and teeth brushing bouts are probably inconsequential compared to industrial farming, unless you live in a desert community or the mountains",3.0,Other

You can't decrypt them, but you can check passwords against them (""offline"", on the computer of the attacker, very fast and with no limit).Someone bruteforces many of these passwords.That person, or someone else who got the bruteforced list, now tries those passwords on other sites. Usually they already know that someone with username 'foo' used 'password123' on site 1, 'badpassword' on site 2, etc. - so they will try these on other sites trying the same user name. They don't need many attempts per user, and the limit is usually quite high and usually resets after some time and/or after the attacker gets a new IP (otherwise each failed attack or just a series of typos like when you forget to turn off caps lock would lock the legitimate user out), and definitely resets after the user successfully logs in.Hard retry limits are rare for the reason stated above. Some banks etc. use these; those users are usually attacked with phishing attacks instead.Because online brute force attacks are so rare, you don't need a super strong password - it's more important that it is unique.

This might not help him too much but if you have a password which is easy to guess it could be possible to get it this way.The attacker might also be able to get a copy of the user table in the database somehow. There might be a bug somewhere allowing them to read data from the database, the database might have a copy somewhere they can get it from, there might be an employee of the company or one of the service vendors with access to the database who might be subject to bribery or extortion. Having a copy of the cryptographically hashed password will allow them to circumvent the password attempt limit as they would be validating the passwords themselves. They can even use distributed computing, GPUs or FPGAs to speed up the password validation. Depending on how the hash is implemented they might also be able to try each password for every user at once instead of one user at a time.They might also have been able to get the password from a different service you use. As a lot of people use the same username and password for all services they are able to log into all of your services even if only one is compromised.The most common recommendation is therefore to use a password manager, for example 1password or keepass.

/*# sourceMappingURL=IdCard.85bee69f2f559267015c.css.map*/On a piano, that's easy, you just play the black key instead of the white key.  On a stringed instrument, you just change your finger position. For most wind instruments (flutes, clarinets, etc) they have tons of different holes and fingering arrangement possibilities that allow you to change the key.A harmonica, however, only has 10 holes, each of which can only play 2 notes (technically more with lip and tongue movements, but if we're talking about just your standard ""blow out, suck in"" note, then it's 2 notes). Those notes are set so if you start at the left side and go right, blowing out a sucking in, it will play up the scale (Do, Re, Mi etc).  So, for example, if a harmonica is in the key of C, then the notes it will play will always be C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C.Unlike the instruments mentioned above, the harmonica doesn't give you a built in option to play any other notes (outside of more complex mouth manipulation). So, if a song is written in the key of G, and you have a C Major harmonica, you are going to to run into an issue every time you get to an F... the harmonica will play of F, but the song calls for an F#.  So, to properly play the song, you're going to need a harmonica in the key of G.All that being said, the ""common"" harmonica is going to be in C, and you CAN play any note through mouth manipulation, but if you're a serious player, it'd be better to have a harmonica in the key of your song.",2.0,Other

1332,"Neural /sensory adaptation. That is, your sensory neurons will actually stop firing after exposure to a prolonged, constant stimulusFor example, when something is touching your skin for the first time, say, a new watch on your wrist, all your sensory nerves are firing. Neural adaptation is the process of your body getting used to the watch on your wrist and eventually no longer firing sensory neurons to let you know there's something there. Which is why you feel like your wrist is 'naked' when you don't wear a watch after a while of wearing one constantly. The stimulus has changed and the neurons are now firing at a different frequency they are used to.Not all sensory neurons adapt, and some (phasic) adapt fadter than others (tonic).Changes to the intensity of a stimulus (volume, pressure, light) will throw the balance again and cause you to notice the stimulusThere's a really cool thing about the feeling you get when you're sleeping and you feel like you're falling that's to do with it too",13.0,Other

1347,Bankruptcy does not mean someone has no assets. It also doesn't mean they necessarily get out of their existing debts without paying them.When a person or company declares bankruptcy they are saying they cannot satisfy their current debts on time or in full. The courts are asked to step in and mediate who gets paid how much and in what order/time frame.For example if you owe $5 million due today and own a $10 million mansion without any cash you would declare bankruptcy. You have assets but they aren't liquid. You could probably sell the mansion for only $5 million nearly instantly but that would be a huge waste; the courts will decide a balance between haste and a reasonable price.,19.0,Other

If you add up all of these assets they might come out to a few million dollars - if you sold them all and got top dollar for them.In the case of celebrity or athelete bankruptcies, the amount they owe is comparable or greater than the sum total of their assets. What? How can they rack up such huge debts? Who would loan them so much money? Well, their ability to pay it back.If you're a banker, and a successful grammy winning rap star comes to you about a $10M loan to open a chain of Ice-T branded frozen yogurt smoothie shops, you look at the Ferraris and the mansion and go ""ok, so at worst, I could seize those."" and at best, who knows, maybe the chain takes off. If you're a SMART banker you ask to see business cases, ask whose going to be running the franchising and what other business they've been part of. If you're a DUMB banker or maybe you're also a fan and a little star-struck, you get flown to a private beach on star's private jet to hang with his entourage for a week, after which you have no problem signing off on a $10M business loan.Of course I'm blurring business vs. personal here, but its this general kind of idea. Also, a lot of these celebrities just flat out don't pay income tax, thats where a lot of this debt gets racked up. How does one forget to pay income tax? Well, if you don't have a good business manager/investment broker as part of your entourage... or worse you leave you money matters up to your cousin's sister in law husband who took an accounting course in community college.... well, they might just not be looking out for your financial well being.  A lot of atheletes and celebrities wind up poor because their homies simply are homies when thigns are good and the money is rolling in, but when your latest album flops or you get cut because of a freak knee injury, all of a sudden they dissappear.Lots of celebrities simply have no idea where the money comes from, who it goes to, and how its managed; and they are exceptionally easy to manipulate by those who aren't necessarily aligned with the celebrity's best interests.",3.0,Other

1390,"This is correct but only relevant to some extent. What you are referring to here, proposed mainly by a cognitive theory named “exemplar theory” is a really good explanations of phenomena such as listening to a song and remembering exactly where you were the last time you heard it. As you say, our brain “saves” things in memory that are not directly related to the item itself (eg the song) but indirectly related too (such as the place where you listened to it, who you were with, the smell of the place, etc).However, in this particular case, the link between the concept of a word (eg the concept of “table”) and the actual phonological form of the word (eg the sound sequence “table”) is often a direct, one-to-one mapping (sometimes it’s one-to-many, like the concept of “big” can be mapped with “big”, “huge”, “massive”, etc).The reason why this phenomenon happens, as I’ve explained in the answer below, is mainly because this direct link between concept and form is somehow temporarily missing.

""I am friendly, I can work with anyone.""  Yeah...no.If your company picked you up, moved you across the planet, and dropped you with merely similar people with different heirarchal structures and habits and traditions, it would still take a long time to acclimate, even more in a high stress environment.  Rigorous training, even if it seems to be casually not related, it provides a standard environment so that people are more interchangeable.It also functions psychologically - everyone you're working with went through the same shit, is there for the same purpose, is doing things the same way.  Group bonding that transcends physical presence.As such, it helps people also be more secure.  People who don't fit in are noticed really quickly.  So either a domsetic that can't adapt, or a foreign agent.

1509,"Different chemical reaction create different amount of energy as heat.  You can look at energy density you see the difference. Wood have an energy density of 18 MJ per kg, but Natural gas have an energy density of 53.6 MJ per kg, so you can get more heat by burning natural gas vs wood, which gonna help you get higher temperature.When you burn something the chemical reaction need an oxydizer, usually oxygen. So if you can provide the fire with more oxygen, more chemical reaction will happen, which will create more heat and increase the temperature.Limiting the heat lost. A fire in open air will get decent oxygen, but it will also lose a lot of heat to the air surrounding it. If you can make your fire inside an isolated furnace, you will lose less heat to the outside and your fire will be able to accumulate heat until it reach an higher equilibrium temperature, where the amount of energy it create equal the energy it lost to the outside. The higher the temperature, the faster it lost the heat, so you can just accumulate the heat to infinity, you gonna reach an equilibrium at some point, the better your isolation the higher the equilibrium.Note that you don't necessarily need to reach the 3000 celsius temperature, there is some chemical tricks to melt something at lower temperature.",5.0,Other

DJs get a bad rap but it takes some talent to be good. What you have in front of you is a multi channel mixer. This is ELI5 so let's keep this simple, this is a 2 channel mixer. One song is playing on the first mixer, and the DJ is cueing up the next one on the other side. What he is hearing in his headphones is not what is being played to the audience but either the next song or both tracks at once, and he is trying to match the beat to the current track, find the right time to blend them together for a seamless transition, add pitch, tone, bass, effects, slow one track down, speed one up.. Ect. He/she is working on making sure the beat don't stop because that's what kills the party. Another point to make is he is watching, and playing for the audience, some things work some don't so the DJ has to be reactive to what he is observing with the crowd.

1569,"It helps to know a bit of the history behind what we now think of when we talk about DJing. Hip hop was invented when DJs like Grandmaster Flash developed techniques to match the beats of 2 songs, extend a breakdown using 2 copies of a record, rhythmic scratching etc. Those DJs were all about developing cool techniques to make a bit of a collage with their sets. Grandmaster Flash's Adventures on the Wheel of Steel was essentially a single-length version of one of these sets. Keep in mind that at this point, the records these DJs played hadn't been produced especially for DJs. This is in contrast to dance music, which is a different culture and different technique. Dance music sets were (and still are) about long, flowing sets, and playing the hottest new tracks. Dance music producers are made or broken by DJs, so they started to kind of standardise their tracks. Same tempo, same arrangement, same intro, same outro. This enabled DJs to very easily transition between tracks and make 6 hour sets. This is why dance music is split up into a thousand sub genres - they're essentially DJ templates. So no, dance music DJs don't do a lot. It's more about knowing the hottest new tracks, and picking the right tracks at the right times in your set. Beat matching 8 bars of music that already have the same beat and tempo is easy. Keeping a party going with 6 hours of music isn't.",19.0,Other

They’ll mix the tracks together as seamlessly as possible and maybe add in some tweaks here and there. This includes looping, key and beat matching and all that.

Additionally, some injuries require extraction and movement that paramedics are not equipped to handle.

Firefighter/EMTs may do the basic work of getting patients on a gurney, scene stabilization, et cetera in between taking turns on chest compressions.  The paramedics will supervise, administer medication and provide breathing support, and so on...Each vehicle may come from another call, and as soon as the patient is being transported in the aid car, the others they go straight to another call without returning to the station.Multiple vehicles provides flexibility and faster response times as new situations develop or are re-prioritized.",3.0,Other
1682,"firefighters are trained and equipped for extractions and rescues.  Paramedics are not.  I don't understand either why fire trucks and firefighters show up to a routine medical call (heart attack, broken leg, stabbing) but for any sort of accident they may be needed.",3.0,Other
1683,"While about everything said here is true, the 'real' reason is for budgeting.It is easier to argue for a bigger budget if you can show how your vehicles/personnel have answered X number of calls this year.  The bigger X is the better equipped you are to try and increase your budget.If you have a $1 million firetruck that is used only 2% of the time the bean counters are not likely to approve other projects as they are needed. So you make them tag along on calls they are not needed on to inflate the numbers.The second 'real' reason is training.  You want people who are used to answering calls when it is really needed.  Best way to train someone to answer calls is to make them actually answer calls. They get to experience the process, learn to not panic, fill out after action reports, and build muscle memory to the entire thing.  Maybe they even get numbed to some of the awful things out there, which can keep them coolheaded in rough situations.All in all you do it because it benefits everyone involved.

1687,"Shortening the barrel pirmarily makes the shotgun easier to conceal, such as under baggy clothing, or in a bag. This is also why you often see shortened shotguns with no stocks, either.Shortening the barrel has the effect of reducing the shot velocity slightly, and widening the spread of the shot. These are further tradeoffs in favor of concealability and the ability to get close to your target before firing.",15.0,Other
1688,"""Sawed off shotgun"" sounds more intimidating and badass than they actually are.  As others have pointed out, in terms of ballistic effectiveness a shorter barrel actually means less projectile velocity and thus less effectiveness on target, plus if you actually ""sawed off"" the barrel you can expect really crappy pellet groupings.  The main, and in my 30 years of experience handling guns and having worked in the industry I'm willing to say the only real, advantages of a short barreled shotgun are concealabilty and maneuverability in close quarters.  They're a good weapon for an ambush or a hitman, they're a poor weapon for anything resembling an actual gunfight.",12.0,Other
1689,"Also to address the ""changes in lethality with its shortening"": projectile effectiveness relies on several factors, but the big three are mass, velocity, and construction.  Construction refers to solid/non-expanding projectile, hollow-point/soft-point/expanding projectile, flat or round nose, etc and I'm not going to go into that here because that's gonna be a lot of information.The most commonly accepted standard of cartridge/bullet power pre-impact  is simply ""energy"", which is measure in ""foot-pounds"" and is calculated using the velocity and mass of the bullet.  It's a pretty reliable standard but breaks down at extremes; very large but slow bullets are far more effective than their energy would suggest, and the inverse is true about very light but fast bullets.  Assuming equal bullet mass and type of construction, a faster bullet will be more powerful.  Longer barrels nearly always result in more velocity (while there are examples of, say, 2"" barrels giving higher numbers than 3"" barrels, you'll notice those are always treated as anomalies because they are.)  So when you shorten the barrel, you lower the velocity and therefore the energy of the projectile.  This will be more pronounced in a round ball type of projectile like a shotgun pellet which relies almost exclusively on velocity and mass to do the work.",2.0,Other

/*# sourceMappingURL=IdCard.85bee69f2f559267015c.css.map*/Yeah, you are not saving water really. What you are saving is the energy necessary to get the water purified and to the person who needs it.If you reduce the amount of water you use in a shower by one gallon every day, that means the amount of energy that was necessary to get that one gallon of water to you has been saved.",5.0,Other
1709,"The water you use will generally end up in a river, then the sea. It will evaporate and return as rain. Today's rain-pattern may result in the rain being where it's not helpful and missing where it would be needed by plants and animals alike.However, the water you use is often not rain-water (treates surface-water from a lake or a stream) but ground-water, water from deep down that filtered through the earth in a process taking decades or centuries. Groundwater is often depleted much, much faster than it's replenished.You see the problem by now, I guess.Also, pumping water for use lowers the level of (closer to surface) ground water, making it harder or even impossible for plants (like deep-rooting trees) to reach it.Finally, pumping, treating and possibly heating water costs energy.",3.0,Other
1714,"I'm going to vastly oversimplify how it works, but:Me: shows up to therapy as a simmering cauldron of low self-esteem and negative self-talkTherapist: gets me to talk about these thingsTherapist: helps me explore where these things probably came from (i.e., formative years with fucked-up parents)Therapist: validates that things were severely fucked-up; provides thoughts on how it could have been handled better (if you really trust and respect your shrink, this voice will eventually replace the shitty-parent voice in your head)Me: continues week-by-week to report new stimulus from my life and how I am handling these thingsTherapist: understands current course of action based on deep understanding of my past, continues to validate current feelings, but also suggests different ways to handle and interpret these things going forwardMe: very slowly learns a different way of thinking about life and about myself, and of handling the things the world throws at meI really believe in therapy as a long-term iterative process.  It doesn't happen in a weekend workshop; you have to keep experiencing the world and give your brain the chance to assimilate the possibility of doing things differently.",936.0,Other
1715,"A lot of therapy (particularly CBT) focuses on identifying unhelpful cognitive shortcuts and changing these.Cognitive shortcuts are literally physical links we form in our mind between two things that commonly occur together. They save us time when assessing the threats or opportunities posed by a person or situation. For example, the link between fire and pain causes us not to touch fire.The problem is that we then unconsciously shortcut to a conclusion without rational thinking.They are behind a whole load of behaviours, for example racism and unconscious bias in job hiring.But they are also behind anxiety and trauma. If you were bullied, you may come to associate social relationships with rejection. If you were abused, you may come to associate trust/relationships with pain. If you’ve had a series of failures, you may come to associate, well, yourself with failure.A lot of therapy is about figuring out what shortcuts your past experiences have given you, why, and challenging these. In this way you can literally change the hard-wiring of your brain to lead to more positive responses and behaviours to situations that challenge you.",208.0,Other
1716,"Your write up is excellent. I think one thing needs to be made more explicit though; what the therapist is doing is handing you and teaching you how to use psychological tools which can help you, but it's still up to you to use them and fix the engine.The silly thing is, people without mental issues typically use these tools as well, but often unconsciously. They were taught during childhood and refined while growing up. I think, many people with issues that stem from childhood simply don't realise that they miss these tools at all because they aren't even aware of their existence as these tools are so obvious to mentally healthy people. Probably why so many people who would benefit from therapy often say they don't need it and going to therapy isn't for them.",41.0,Other

1722,"The psychiatry/psychology distinction is taken care of, so I’ll weigh in on therapy a little bit. Counselors typically have less formal training than psychologists, who carry doctoral degrees, but I’m not aware of conclusive research to suggest that one is necessarily always a better therapist than the other.The most important aspect of therapy is feeling that you have a strong fit with your therapist. This person needs to understand you and see the big picture of your life. You may not find this fit with your first therapist, but I encourage you to give it a few sessions to figure that out. It’s also completely normal not to be able to explain why the fit is or isn’t there. A lot of that stuff is beyond words. Once you find a good fit, you can focus on what is of secondary importance, which is the type of therapy you do with the therapist. One type of therapy that I like a lot is called Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). You can look up “The happiness trap” on YouTube for some short videos that explain some of the core concepts. Again, therapy type (ACT or whatever else) is secondary to fit. Feel free to message me for more info or resources.",3100.0,Other
1723,"How am I supposed to see that the therapist can see 'the big picture of my life' if I haven't the foggiest idea of that myself? Could a therapist simply spout some nice-sounding nonsense without actually understanding the client that could lure them into feeling like they've found ""the therapist for them""?

1724,"This right here. It is like finding someone that you are comfortable talking to because they have to communicate with you the way you are most willing to hear. Two examples I have is I grew up in a family that was scared of homosexuality and during a period where you would use gay an insult my brother said something that I said was gay. I was in trouble for a very long time and told calling him gay would turn him. I spoke to my therapist about it. He called me gay probably fifty times then asked if I was gay. Said ""see it does not work that way"". Someone who could be that straight with me and direct was incredible. He changed my life for the better in many ways over the years and he eventually passed away but showed me how to look for help moving forward. Sorry if this does not make sense I do not get a chance to talk about him much.Here is a link to the camp he started with his wife. https://nuhop.org/camp-nuhopThe second example is a more recent person I started talking to. I told him I stopped taking walks because I would just complain how frustrated I was having to take a walk. He said "" no reason you can't bitch and walk at the same time."" He called me on my bullshit and I needed that. Those are the things I look for.Sorry this is so long.",861.0,Other
1725,"As a former Clinical Psychologist I would add that we were used for more 'complex' cases where significant mental illness / impairments (like dementia / brain injury) existed which meant you really had to be aware of underlying issues to treat effectively. We would also use more 'advanced' techniques than traditional counselling like CBT, DBT etc. If you have a specific *problem* (like phobia, major depression, major anxiety etc...) I'd go for a psychologist as it's really what we trained for.If you need drugs / other medical intervention go to a Psychiatrist. In the UK it's common for a psychologists / psychiatrists to refer patients to each other based on need and for GPs (family doctors) to refer to both  (well when people get referred at all...). This is all UK of course...many Psychiatrists ALSO practice psychotherapy / other psychoanalysis techniques  but they're comparatively rare here (the NHS won't cover that generally for example)For more general issues like general anxiety, relationship issues etc..go to a therapist / counsellor.I may be biased for for kids I'd got for a minimum of a Chartered Psychologist (so Psychologist registered with an appropriate professional body but not necessarily with a Doctorate / Postgrad qualifications) as it's far riskier and potentially more damaging if your therapist is untrained in that case.Oh and I'm no longer a Psychologist so have no skin in the game these days :)EDIT: As many have commented in the US it's VERY different for a variety of reasons (liability, insurance etc...) we don't really have 'therapist culture' in the UK either so they're far less common.",145.0,Other

1736,"Megapixels is just how many light sensitive dots are on the sensor of the camera. In the early days of camera development, more dots meant your image would have better resolution, which made it look better.Nowadays, pixels are getting so small that we can cram 100 million of them onto a sensor the size of a fingernail. The issue with this approach is that the sensor can only receive so much light at once, and obviously a small sensor receives less light than a big one.If a small sensor like you'd see in a phone has loads of pixels, then each individual pixel gets a smaller share of the total light for the sensor.Contrast that to a DSLR, with a sensor of 24/35mm, that has only 24MP for example. The sensor itself is much bigger, and the light is being shared by fewer pixels. This means that each pixel sees a lot more light.Practically this has a few benefits, namely that your camera works better in lower light, and the sensitivity can be turned down, resulting in better noise performance.There are additionao benefits like being able to install large glass lenses with very good optical quality and low focal lengths that allow bokeh to be generated naturally, whereas smartphones tend to (attempt) to add this in software",18.0,Other
1737,"Sensor size, dslr or (mirrorless system camera) are mostly in full frame, apsc or m43 format (864mm2, 329mm2, 225mm2 Sensor area), while good phone sensor are around 1/2.3” (~30mm2). More area means more light captured and you need less software to reduce image noise, and with correct lens you get a very shallow depth of field (lot of bokeh, portrait mode simulates it with multiple lens on phone).Another difference is that you can swap lens on the fly, and you have optical zoom, it’s more versatile. But a good lens can cost more than most phones..",6.0,Other
1738,"I think the new battleground for smartphone cameras is in the software & algorithms, like night mode. It’s amazing what an iPhone 11 or any Google Pixel phone can do in low light.The smartphones sort of hit their peak with megapixels because phones only have so much room for camera sensor size. So if you see a smartphone manufacturer boasting about pixels nowadays, I’d guess that’s not a good thing. It means they’re run out of things to do to improve their camera or their software/algorithms are a bit behind.  And like they explained above, lots of small pixels doesn’t necessarily make for a better picture.",5.0,Other
1739,"Megapixel is the (approximate/rounded) amount of pixels used to capture the image. 5000*5000 pixel in a square would be 25 megapixel.One pixel is (simplified) a single dot with a certain colour/brightness.The more dots you use,  the sharper you can make the image.But: a lot of other factors also determine the quality of the image. Everything above 5-15 megapixel is more than sharp enough to make images that look good. More megapixel only help if you enlarge a tiny portion of that image or want to put the photo on poster size.The most important quality is size - size of the individual pixels and size of the lens - as a bigger lens will simply let more light into the camera, which makes it easier to get the accurate color.So DSLR will have a better quality in almost all situations. (If you want to enlarge a specific portion of the picture, with a DSLR you can attach the correct lens, and the lens will enlarge it.Current smartphones show a incredible quality though, and are up to the task for many situations.",3.0,Other
1740,"Noise, depth of field and optical character make things different. Better is a matter of taste.Noise: as others have said...the first limit to noise is physics. All sensors have a background noise level. When a sensor pit is lit, it creates a signal. The combination of signal and background noise is what gets read. The smaller the pit, the weaker the signal, the smaller the difference between signal and noise. In practical terms, all other things being equal, low light shots on a small sensor will be more noisy. One way some phones try to fix this is by taking multiple images (more than one camera or a bunch of images in series) and using comparison between images to eliminate noise. This works because noise is random and signal is not. Such image stacking is how backyard astronomy is getting really amazing these days.depth of field: large sensor cameras often have lenses that support shooting at reasonable distances with a shallow depth of field. That blurring is very useful when composition does not make your subject 'pop'. There are a number of software solutions to this one...but often natural depth of field just looks better. This is the whole insanity about bokeh.character: when shooting with large sensor cameras, particularly with vintage optics, it is possible to get different character. Some lenses resolve far more detail in the centre than they do the edges at wide apertures...this is bad, unless you are trying to bring your subject out. Some will vignette...the same. Some treat colours a bit differently...and there is a great deal of discussion about the relative merits of leica, zeiss, fuji, nikon, and olympus glass. These sorts of character are often part of filters in cell phones...but they don't get it quite right. That said, cell phones have their own 'look'. Apple phones, for instance, do a great deal of computational manipulation of images that produces a predictable and desired look (heavy saturation, high micro-contrast, exaggerated shadows) that is just as much a 'look' as is the now desired soft focus portra look that you can get out of filters in software like capture one.megapixels have been explained.

/*# sourceMappingURL=IdCard.85bee69f2f559267015c.css.map*/In theory, you could retrofit a coal plant to burn trash instead, in practice the design of the boiler furnace tends to be completely different. The biggest difficulty lies in processing the trash to burn effectively, and in controlling the combustion to ensure efficient mixing of fuel with air.The trash needs to be, as much as possible, sorted, and metallic materials removed such as screws,wires, circuit boards, small appliances. This kind of sorting equipment adds to costs, time, monitoring labor, and complexity. The trash then needs to be shredded. This is a technically more challenging process than crushing coal.Unlike coal or wood,  plastics melt and gain a molasses-like consistency as they burn. This can cause the fuel to clump into a sticky solid mass,  stick to walls, and possibly block bottom ventilation holes. This can slow the burn process, reducing power output. Note that in order to produce the most power output you want to burn the fuel a quicky as possible.Also, not all trash materials are flammable, so you end up with a higher proportion of ash and metallic waste. Many plastic consumer items contain embedded glass fibers to strengthen them, for example. These may melt slightly but they don't burn.Some mechanism or special feature needs to be added to keep the burn chamber cleaned and to remove ash and unburned plastic char.Trash often contains PVC type plastics which produce corrosive hydrogen chloride gas when burned. This can corrode the boiler tubes and exhaust handling equipment. It needs to be scrubbed from the exhaust gas.Biggest reason is that coal fired power plants are simply not cost effective to run in most areas, as they have significant maintainance costs for the boiler. At present, natural gas burning direct gas turbines are significantly more cost effective, and tend to be more efficient.So a trash burning plant would fare no better than a coal plant without being subsidized by local governments. Nobody wants to do this because why not just pay a cheaper price for power from a natural gas plant?",16.0,Other
1752,"Great answer with lots of detail. Thanks.The only thing I I'd argue with is your last sentence.  Some countries do have very high landfill dumping costs (direct costs plus taxation) so even without government subsidies, the cost can get closer to coal and gas for energy production.  We can't expect commercial companies to pay more, just because its right.  But governments can incentivise companies to do the right thing.",3.0,Other

Relatedly, orchestras strive to perfectly recreate the piece because someone else composed it. If they decided to change Beethoven's 5th on the fly, is it really still Beethoven's 5th?The second difference is that orchestras typically require more precision and coordination than a smaller band. If two trumpets play the correct part and one messes up, you're going to hear it. If the bassist in a rock band hits a wrong note, there's less to compare the mistake to. Popular genres of music also typically involve a lot more fluidity and improvisation. So long as you're playing the right chords, you can switch up exactly how you play each part and still have things sound good. That doesn't work with 100 people playing at once.",22.0,Other

In rock there’s also more room for improvisation, “going with the flow”, and the players rarely play everything exactly the same way every time. (Drummers change up their drum fills, guitarists change up their licks and strumming patterns, etc).With orchestral music though, the pieces are usually longer and more complex, the playing skill standard is higher, you’re expected to play something a very specific way, and they usually don’t get to rehearse the same pieces over and over and over again.

Typically, an orchestra is funded by donors, ticket sales wouldn’t fully cover the conductor, soloist, and musicians pay. Musicians are typically paid “per service” meaning each rehearsal and performance counts as a service. So to memorize music means a tremendous amount more work, and likely more pay. Frankly, many orchestras are financially strapped as is. (Go buy tickets and support your local orchestras!)Pop and rock- as already stated, most people have written their own part and it’s usually not nearly as complex, and there’s typically not 10+ people playing one part. Secondly, a lot of musicians will use charts. I play a number of groups that do tons of covers. I can’t memorize 400 songs, so we use charts.

I say unfortunately because it's long been a fabric of the game.In other sports fighting isn't part of the culture of the game. Baseball bench clearing brawls rarely happen. Even when they do there's rarely fighting. It's usually just two teams blowing off steam at one another over some unwritten rule perceived differences. Since both teams have a lot of players on them it's usually just a large group separating the few players that are mad at one another. Cooler heads usually prevail.Basketball fights are even rarer. The thing with basketball fights that can make them dangerous is that the players are very large and there are very few players on the court on each team that can hold the other players back or get between them to get them to cool off. Add to it that players aren't wearing heavy protective gear like they are in ice hockey or North American football.

An actual strobe light may cause a seizure, but those are not being used as much in emergency vehicles, they're mostly LED lighting which may not cause a seizure. Same with reflections on glass, or signal lights, or lights from a passing vehicle. That means the person may be still be safe to drive because what causes the seizure isn't likely going to be found while driving.In short, just because someone may have seizures, doesn't mean they're caused by lights.

I think when you sing a song in a different language it appears to line up because you're purposely singing in rhythm with the music, but in reality the translated words aren't spoken on the exact same note/syllable as the original, but it still sounds good because you're still singing in rhythm to the song. But to further reinforce my point, try looking up a rap song in a different language, and turn in the english subtitles, you'll find yourself saying ""wow these guys suck"". I say rap in specific because unlike melodic music that is sang (or screamed 😉) rap is focused primarily on delivery, flow and rhyming, and the lines are written in form of bars (like poetry) now obviously foreign words dont still rhyme after being translated because thatd be freaky af, but you'll notice that the words dont line up with the music anymore because each line is meant to fit in a specific spot on the beat (for delivery/punchlines). So I think that the coincidence you're finding is simply that you know how the song goes, so you're singing the words in english in tune to the song, but you most likely aren't saying the exact right words in the exact right places, but you don't notice because it's of the way those particular genres work.",0.0,Other

Therefore, we are real, because it's more energy efficient to be real, than simulated.You can't store more information in the state of an electron than would be required to describe the state of an electron. You need at least one electron's worth of matter in your computer for every electron that exists within the simulation. A simulation of the surface of a planet that's detailed down to the subatomic level would require a computer that's at least as large as the surface of the planet it's simulating. And this is where the math part of the entire debate, proves that the simulation can't exist. For practical reason, a simulation of the atomic structures would have to be much larger than the simulation itself.The civilization living in that simulation wouldn't be capable of building a simulation the same size as the one they're living in, since there wouldn't be enough atoms in their simulated universe to build a computer capable of achieving it. This means that the endless recursion of simulations-within simulations that people assume would be happening when the say it's probable that we're living in a simulation is impossible. The only way simulation theory works, is if you turn it into a philosophical debate, and throw out everything about how matter works.Even if you're simulated world doesn't exist until it's observed, the problem is, that once it's observed, it's simulated down to the atomic level. A visible Earth surface, just one atom thin, would take 1037 atoms to simulate. That's not counting anything below the surface, like earthworms, fossils, oceans of sea life, rock layers, or a magnetic core. For what purpose would such a simulation need to be this exactly detailed? That is the real question nobody can logically answer.",3.0,Other
1833,"Who says it's simulated to that level of detail? Maybe you're the only consciousness in the simulation, and the program only gives you enough detail for what you need at the moment. That's basically the way video games work today. They only render what is immediately within your field of vision.",3.0,Other
1834,"The simulation argument actually only claims that one of three propositions is true. The three taken together cover every possible outcome, so logically you have to adopt one of them. They are:We will never create technology sufficiently advanced to run an 'ancestor simulation' of virtual people experiencing a virtual historical environment that is utterly realistic, such that the simulated people inside it can't tell that they and their world is simulated.We will have the technology, but for all time there will be political or other restraints in place to stop us running ancestor simulations.By simple probability, we are more likely to be simulated humans in an ancestor simulation than we are to be the original biological human it is modelled on.If you agree with (1), then the whole question doesn't arise, but so far all the curves of increase in computing complexity point towards such a simulation being possible in the relatively near future, at least of a constrained area (we aren't talking about simulated universes, just simulated environments sufficient for a historical event to play out). One explanation might be that the human race ceases to exist before we have time to invent ancestor simulation level technology, which would point towards a rapidly approaching nuclear or plague or other cosmic catastrophe.If you agree with (2), then you have a pretty pessimistic outlook on the future, with some kind of fascist government or fanatical religion exerting absolute control forever on how technology is used by everyone. Again, mass extinction might explain this.So, how do we get to (3)? The argument goes that if we have the technology to simulate ancestral environments (i.e. 1 isn't true) and there is no religious or political obstacle to running such simulations (i.e. 2 isn't true), then such simulations will be run multiple times over the course of future history (that's just the kind of curious monkey species we are). For any point in history then, there will be one 'real' set of people and events, and some large number of simulated copies of those people and events, due to uncounted generations of future historians running simulations (perhaps a class of students doing their homework on early 21st century users of reddit).If you now consider yourself as a random sample from all possible examples of you, both the real and the simulated, then you are more likely to be one of the many simulated versions than the one 'real' version, just as if you had one red ball and 99 blue balls in a bag, you would rationally predict that if you reached in and pulled one out, it would have a 99% chance of being blue, not red.So either you are a pessimist about tech, or a pessimist about society and freedom, or you are unavoidably forced to conclude that the odds are that you are a simulation run by a future historian.Following on from this, you might want to take some precautions against that historian shutting down the simulation you live in. You've got to keep them interested, either by being the focus of historic events yourself, or just from hanging around close to historic events that they'll focus on. Try to be in the crowd close to the grassy knoll, or be the gunman in the book repository, rather than sitting in your room reading reddit a thousand miles away from history happening...",2.0,Other
1835,"It kind of works like this. If we are capable of creating a simulated universe here in real life that means it can be done. If technology can progress to the point where every individual were to be able to create their own simulated universe you would have over 7 billion of them. At that point what are the odds that you yourself are actually from the ""real universe""?",2.0,Other
1837,"The sensor in the camera can be more or less sensitive to light. What we are worried about referred to SNR (signal to noise ratio), the more sensitive the sensor the more of that SNR is actually noise and that noise shows up as a grain. When you have a lot of light available you turn the ISO (image sensor sensitivity) WAY down so the it only picks up obvious signal and not much noise. You have little to no grain and the image looks almost perfect.",7.0,Other
1838,"Let’s say that a color for each of the camera’s pixels can have a value between 0 (very dark) and 1000 (very bright). Under low light conditions all those subpixels would have very low values (let’s say between 0 and 5) so you amplify (i.e. multiply) them to get the full range of brightness you’d expect. Otherwise the image would be mostly dark. The issue here is that the smallest amount of noise or deviation can have a large impact. For example if you read 2 instead of 3, then multiply it with 200 you’ll get a huge error. Gradients will also look bad because you only have a few steps.These small errors are called noise and can happen because of heat or interference.",4.0,Other

1846,"This is straight up the wrong answer.To get more light, you COULD open the shutter for longer, but that wouldn’t contribute to more noise — quite the opposite actually, the image would have LESS noise because the slower shutter accommodates more light. The same principle of increasing amplitude in audio relates to gain or ISO in film, not shutter speed.Noise, or digital ISO, happens when the sensitivity of a sensor is “boosted” to assign color values to pixels and articially brighten the image. Three things govern exposure: aperture, shutter speed, and ISO.Aperture is the opening of the lens, how “wide open” the iris blades of a lens’ optical element are. The larger and wider the opening, the greater a frequency of light can be let in (this is measured in f-number or f-stops).The smaller the opening, the sharper the image, because focal points are crisper, but the less light is let into the image sensor. An f-stop close to 1/1, let’s says f1/1.8 is very wide open, and so produces a lot of light. And f-stop of 1/8 is proportionally much smaller, and therefore produces less light. These fractions are usually expressed without the 1/ to avoid redundancy. So f1.8, f2.8, f8. You get the picture.Shutter speed is the length of time for which the image sensor is exposed to the open aperture or iris. Expressed as fractions of a second S1/30, or one thirtieth of a second, is considered the “slowest” that you can get away with and still not see much motion blur. Anything faster, like S1/1000 will have much sharper movement and less blur, because images are being captured so precisely in such a quick snippet of time.For longer, slower shutter speeds in digital sensor, you WILL get some salt-and-pepper noise from photodiode leakage currents, but this is not the “video noise” with purple and green specs that you see in photos in low light.Shutter held open for a longer time, let’s say 2 seconds total, will produce BRIGHTER images — because the image sensor of a camera received more light over that longer time — but the blur will make things almost indiscernable.Lastly, there is ISO or grain. ISO in the film days was the amount of granulated silver halide in celluloid. The more silver film had, the more light the image could receive, but the grainier the image.In digital days, ISO relates to gain, or how artificially“boosted” the sensitivity of an image sensor is. With a moderately wide aperture, moderate shutter and “regular” ISO you see a pleasing image. But in low light, to keep that same aperture and shutter, a camera needs to boost the ISO, or the image sensor signal, to accommodate more light.@keyframes _2bkYZH_kJx5pIHW0Ts5P6e{0%{opacity:0}to{opacity:1}}._2uSuNRa3OeptFDJCKQ3vU6{position:absolute;border-radius:4px;animation:_2bkYZH_kJx5pIHW0Ts5P6e .5s step-end;white-space:pre-wrap;z-index:100;box-shadow:0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,.25);background:var(--newCommunityTheme-body);--contentTooltip-caretColor:var(--newCommunityTheme-body);--contentTooltip-leftMargin:0}._2uSuNRa3OeptFDJCKQ3vU6:after{position:absolute;line-height:6px;transform:scaleY(.7);margin-left:var(--contentTooltip-leftMargin);color:var(--contentTooltip-caretColor)}._2uSuNRa3OeptFDJCKQ3vU6._1rF-A55THyDL-rQ9ZUDQ4_{margin-top:-6px;--contentTooltip-leftMargin:-7px}._2uSuNRa3OeptFDJCKQ3vU6._1rF-A55THyDL-rQ9ZUDQ4_:after{top:100%;content:""\25BC"";text-shadow:0 4px 4px rgba(0,0,0,.25);left:50%}._2uSuNRa3OeptFDJCKQ3vU6._1MHCyMQAMeqRqf5DPWWeq3{margin-top:6px;--contentTooltip-leftMargin:-7px}._2uSuNRa3OeptFDJCKQ3vU6._1MHCyMQAMeqRqf5DPWWeq3:after{content:""\25B2"";top:auto;bottom:100%;text-shadow:0 -4px 4px rgba(0,0,0,.1);left:50%}._2uSuNRa3OeptFDJCKQ3vU6.nVD-oexLbZI_4QjhrkLFz{margin-left:6px}._2uSuNRa3OeptFDJCKQ3vU6.nVD-oexLbZI_4QjhrkLFz:after{content:""\25C0"";left:-12px;top:50%;text-shadow:-4px 0 4px rgba(0,0,0,.25)}._2uSuNRa3OeptFDJCKQ3vU6.KRVDnoE1RIC5qyqQLXxGG{margin-left:-6px}._2uSuNRa3OeptFDJCKQ3vU6.KRVDnoE1RIC5qyqQLXxGG:after{content:""\25B6"";left:calc(100% - 2px);top:calc(50% - 2px);text-shadow:4px 0 4px rgba(0,0,0,.25)}

/*# sourceMappingURL=IdCard.85bee69f2f559267015c.css.map*/Essentially, the camera isn’t receiving more light through the width of the lens or the amount of time the shutter gives it, so it has to compensate.You see noise because the camera is taking what it guesses the color values for each pixel are, and brightening it based on that approximation. Because there isn’t enough light to exposure properly, the camera manifests a noisy image with the wrong color values added to different pixels at different times. This produces video noise.Edit:You asked about the human eye, too. This one’s easy. The human eye uses two receptors, called rods and cones, to work together in producing images in your brain.Cones work to produce color vision, rods work to produce night vision but cannot differentiate color. You have 125 million photo receptors in your eyes, and 120 million are rods. This is because cones are very good at seeing color, and use near perfect light situations for their 5 million receptors to work. Behind the scenes, the rods are the most sensitive to light, and so they do most of the work of producing an image in your brain.In low light, your cones can hardly function, they struggle. So your brain uses the rods to produce let’s say a “black and white” image that is based on shape, and the cones (just like a camera’s processor with limited light, boosting ISO) do their best to send information to your brain to assign color values. This is why you can make out shapes easily in low light, but not color.It’s also why you perceive a “noisy” image, because your brain is trying to produce a colorful image without enough photo sensitivity from the cones that send those values.",19.0,Other

1848,"Using your audio analogy, amplifying the input signal would equivalent to ISO on a camera, not shutter speed. I guess the equivalent to shutter speed in an audio set up would be making your sound source louder, or moving the mic closer to the instrument. You're exposing the mic/sensor to more signal.",2.0,Other

1853,"In video it’s from high ISO, which is needed in low light situations. It’s similar to cranking up the volume of a microphone if the source is too far away. Eventually you’ll pickup the source you want, but now you’re also amplifying all of the other ‘noise’ around it.In video, when you crank up your sensor sensitivity (high ISO) you do the same thing. The sensor is now picking up al of the ‘noise’, but it’s represented as a grainy effect.",0.0,Other

The biome that is the soil, the clay the microorganisms, the minerals, everything is contaminated from those processes.The land would have had to been stripped from something else, something that was never a conventional farm for it to be actually organic.The term is tossed around now to get you to pay more money for a product that used less damaging ingredients yes, but it still uses practices that wouldn’t actually be considered “organic”.The challenge is the loose definition of the term organic.Some countries all it means is non toxic pesticides, non gmo seeds etc. It’s a marketing ploy to sell beer plain and simple, all while trying to connect(exploit) people who want to support ethical, sustainable or organic type farming.Mind you it’s a good start, but it’s a misleading term to use when the label isn’t clearly defined in the first place.",2.0,Other

1900,"According to Planned Parenthood:How effective are condoms against pregnancy?If you use condoms perfectly every single time you have sex, they’re 98% effective at preventing pregnancy. But people aren’t perfect, so in real life condoms are about 85% effective.Basically there are 2-3% failures that are problems with the condom (holes, thin spots leading to tears...) And 12-13% failures caused by not using condoms correctly likeputting the condom on the wrong way then switching it to the right way.wearing the wrong size leading to slippage, breakage or roll downnot checking the condom during sextouching the outside of the condom with hands coated in pre come/semen.using expired condoms",3.0,Other
1901,"Let me just add that the term ""effectiveness"" may not be what you think it is. The 97% figure comes from the pearl index, which is 2-3 for a condom (a pearl index of 0 would be a perfect contraceptive). People then do a ""100% - 3 is 97% effective, right?"" kind of calculation, which is wrong, or at least misleading.A pearl index of 3 for any given contraception method means that 3 out of 100 women get pregnant in a year when they've used this method for contraception. It does not say how many times those women had sex.So, 97% ""effecitveness"" does not mean that 3% of condoms fail. It's the chance of not getting pregnant within a year when using condoms as contraception.",2.0,Other
1902,"When talking about the effectiveness of birth control, the failure percentage isn't per incident.  If it were 97% each time would translate to 22% ""effective"", even worse than doing nothing (40%-50% effective per year).  97% refers to the chances a fertile, sexually active couple will conceive after a year of activity.The real per-incident rate is around 0.06%, or about one pregnancy in every 1700 chances.  Assuming proper and consistent use.",2.0,Other
1903,"Because they fail 3% of the time.Condoms fail in a variety of ways. They can break; they can have small holes; they can come off during use. These are very rare, but they do happen, and so they don't have a 100% effectiveness.",-1.0,Other
1904,"Bear in mind that ""failure"" of a condom can take many forms. It doesn't mean pregnancy. It means exposure or passage of bodily fluids from one partner to the other. And the majority of the ""failures"" are from misuse. There are people who honestly think you can turn them inside out and re-use them. There are people who think putting more than one on at a time makes them more effective. There are people who think they need a Magnum when a normal condom is loose on them.",0.0,Other
1906,"A few factors: When you are asleep, your brain goes through 90 minute cycles. You gradually fall farther and farther into ""deep"", or slow-wave sleep, until you hit REM sleep, dream a bit, and gradually leave slow-wave sleep into a position just below wakefulness, then you start again slowly going into deep sleep...When you first fall asleep, you will fall much further into deep-sleep in your cycle, and as you near the end of sleep, the slow-wave portion of your cycle will be much more active. (Here's a figure: https://www.howsleepworks.com/images/hypnogram.jpg )If you are woken up during slow-wave sleep, especially when you have not slept in a while, it is extremely jarring because you are essentially trying to ramp up your brain activity from low-to-high like starting a car.Why would you be tired if you had slept all night? This is probably due to the hormones released while you're sleeping. There's a delicate balance of hormones that guide you though you sleep. (For example, GABA might increase and puuuull you into slow-wave, then ACh might increase and puuuull you out of it) These hormones help you stay asleep. Unfortunately, they don't click on and off like a light-switch and take some time to fade when waking up. This can leave you a little groggy.Also probably related: You tend to go through a final faze of REM before waking up. REM is, hands-down, the coolest part of sleep. You will literally die if you are deprived of REM. REM stands for Rapid-Eye-Movement, because your eyes move around when you're dreaming! When you're dreaming, your brain will light up in all sorts of areas of your brain that act out things! When you are in REM, your brain is LITERALLY DOING everything you are doing in your dreams, and your body release chemicals that paralyze you from the neck-down and stop you from getting up and running around! (People with strange sleep problems, it comes from a deficiency in this!) Sometimes people will wake up with sleep paralysis, where they wake up and are conscience, but can't move their body yet because this paralysis hasn't worn off yet. It's pretty scary, but not dangerous. Anyway, since you're going from this paralysis state into wakefulness, it takes your body a little while to adjust. That's all.TL;DR Hormones that are in your system that help you sleep take time to leave your system when you wake up.",14.0,Other
1907,"Man, REM really is amazing. ""Let me paralyze your body so your brain can pretend you're flying."" I should take better care of my sleeping habits.",6.0,Other

1910,"You didn't  sleep enough, or you slept too long. your body has rhythms that you need to sleep inside. if you are in the deep part of sleep when you wake up you will  be groggy, which is why people recommend only taking 20-40 minute naps at most, or going through an entire sleep cycle. Waking up naturally is best, but failing that you can look up how to estimate your average sleep cycle and set an alarm for 2 or 3 complete cycles and go to bed at a regular time. Keep your room dark because light can interfere with the brain chemicals that help you get restful sleep.",0.0,Other
1911,"Western music uses a 12-tone equal temperament system.  That means that there are 12 equally-spaced notes to each octave.The reason this works so well is that humans find simple ratios between 2 notes as more pleasing and consonant if their frequencies are related by simple ratios.  For example, an A at 440hz and an E at 660hz give a 3:2 ratio, which we perceive as a perfect fifth. 12-TET happens to give us really good approximations for these ratios, such as 4:3, 5:4, 6:5, and these intervals are what Western music is rooted in.But you don't need to pick 12! Why not 19? Or 22? 24? These equal temperament systems also have good approximations for simple ratios.   But you also get tons of new, foreign ratios that 12-TET can't do.Does it sound bad? Well, go you YouTube and have a listen! They will sound consonant but very alien.  Whether you like that feel is a matter of personal opinion.Tldr - Yes, there are infinite notes between the 12 we use.  They can sound good if you divide the octave with consonance in mind.Edit: At least 1 form of Western music uses one of these in-between notes! Barbershop singing. One also shows up in 'Happy Birthday to You"", in the 'many many more' part at the end (on more).",18.0,Other
1912,"At least 1 form of Western music uses one of these in-between notes! Barbershop singing. One also shows up in 'Happy Birthday to You"", in the 'many many more' part at the end (on more).That's borderline cheating. That microtone only appears as a part of a slide, so technically you have infinitely many tones in there. You still need to land on a half-step or it will sound flat.",3.0,Other
1913,"At least 1 form of Western music uses one of these in-between notes! Barbershop singingThank you for mentioning this!  I'm a in a high end barbershop chorus, and the number of times we tune outside of the standard notes. Being told things like ""Leads, that third is going to be a bit larger than the piano"" or ""basses, you'll need to sit a bit lower on that 5th"" and the like are very commonplace.  With barbershop harmonies, to get the proper ""ring"" that most people recognize, the tuning needs to be extremely precise (like we're usually tuning around the 5 cent mark, where 100 cents is a half step).I'll add, just for /u/hejjejejej@keyframes _2bkYZH_kJx5pIHW0Ts5P6e{0%{opacity:0}to{opacity:1}}._2uSuNRa3OeptFDJCKQ3vU6{position:absolute;border-radius:4px;animation:_2bkYZH_kJx5pIHW0Ts5P6e .5s step-end;white-space:pre-wrap;z-index:100;box-shadow:0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,.25);background:var(--newCommunityTheme-body);--contentTooltip-caretColor:var(--newCommunityTheme-body);--contentTooltip-leftMargin:0}._2uSuNRa3OeptFDJCKQ3vU6:after{position:absolute;line-height:6px;transform:scaleY(.7);margin-left:var(--contentTooltip-leftMargin);color:var(--contentTooltip-caretColor)}._2uSuNRa3OeptFDJCKQ3vU6._1rF-A55THyDL-rQ9ZUDQ4_{margin-top:-6px;--contentTooltip-leftMargin:-7px}._2uSuNRa3OeptFDJCKQ3vU6._1rF-A55THyDL-rQ9ZUDQ4_:after{top:100%;content:""\25BC"";text-shadow:0 4px 4px rgba(0,0,0,.25);left:50%}._2uSuNRa3OeptFDJCKQ3vU6._1MHCyMQAMeqRqf5DPWWeq3{margin-top:6px;--contentTooltip-leftMargin:-7px}._2uSuNRa3OeptFDJCKQ3vU6._1MHCyMQAMeqRqf5DPWWeq3:after{content:""\25B2"";top:auto;bottom:100%;text-shadow:0 -4px 4px rgba(0,0,0,.1);left:50%}._2uSuNRa3OeptFDJCKQ3vU6.nVD-oexLbZI_4QjhrkLFz{margin-left:6px}._2uSuNRa3OeptFDJCKQ3vU6.nVD-oexLbZI_4QjhrkLFz:after{content:""\25C0"";left:-12px;top:50%;text-shadow:-4px 0 4px rgba(0,0,0,.25)}._2uSuNRa3OeptFDJCKQ3vU6.KRVDnoE1RIC5qyqQLXxGG{margin-left:-6px}._2uSuNRa3OeptFDJCKQ3vU6.KRVDnoE1RIC5qyqQLXxGG:after{content:""\25B6"";left:calc(100% - 2px);top:calc(50% - 2px);text-shadow:4px 0 4px rgba(0,0,0,.25)}

/*# sourceMappingURL=IdCard.85bee69f2f559267015c.css.map*/ : tuning like that is called ""Just Intonation.""  It's a form of tuning different from ""equal temperament"" (12-TET) that involves adjusting your tone to make the right sound.  This is most common in a cappella singing, because you aren't needing to tune to a 12-TET instrument.  You can also find it on non-guitar stringed instruments. Even though the strings themselves are tuned to a standard note normally, they can finger anything and create some amazing sounds when done right.",3.0,Other

1915,"I would like to take a different approach to this answer.Microtonal sounds (outside of the traditional 11 notes you get before an octave repeats) have been around for a long time. Piano, as an instrument is not designed to be microtonal. However, some folks have created ways of “bending” notes on a piano to achieve microtonal colors.As far as the “weirdness” or “dissonance”, you’ve been hearing it your whole life. Turkish music, Indian music, Native American singing, music of the Far East. Heck, find a group of excellent horn players and they will show you how they have to adjust some notes to get them to be “in tune with the chord”.But piano was designed to provide a specific kind of sound and it’s harder to deviate than other stringed instruments.In harmony and melody, it’s all about color and a tension and (maybe) release. Microtones take a 12 bit set up and make it potentially infinite. Approach with an open set of ears and a desire for new flavor.",4.0,Other
1916,"The notes that we have on the piano are mathematically related and we have become accustomed to their harmonies (which are also mathematically related).Yes, there are notes between the half-steps of a piano. We're not used to how they sound with the half-step notes of the piano.",3.0,Other
1917,"I wrote some of this for a friend a few months ago. It explains the mathematical relationships between some of the notes.This page is a table of the frequencies of the notes as a piano is laid out.http://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.htmlThe note A4 (440 Hz) is the standard, kind of like 0° F or 0° C is a standard. It's convenient to count from somewhere, and A4 (440Hz) is where musicians count from.Here's the interesting thing:If you double 440 you get 880.A4 is 440Hz. Double that is A5 (880), which is the same pitch, but one octave higher.A5:A4::2:1(does that make sense? A5 is to A4 as 2 is to 1?)If you picture a line from point Y to point Z, you could represent A4 as a single hill, and you could represent A5 as a hill that goes exactly halfway from Y to Z, and a mirror-image valley that goes the rest of the way from Y to Z. A full sine wave. The A5 hill is exactly half the length of the A4 hill. The A5 hill is a 1/2 ratio to the A4 hill.Here's the next interesting thing:Simple adjacent ratios produce other pleasing note combinations.Here are the first few simple adjacent ratios:2:13:24:35:46:5These ratios form the basis of music theory.2:1 is called an octave. A5:A4, for example. 880:4403:2 is called a perfect fifth. E5:A4.  660:4404:3 is called a perfect fourth. D5:A4.  586.66:4405:4 is a major third. C#5:A4. 550:440and 6:5 is a minor third.

1935,You don't feel heat but heat transfer. So things that are good at transferring heat will feel hotter or colder depending on their actual temperature. And things that suck at transferring heat like cloth or wood will feel more neutral regardless of how hot or cold they are. It's the same reason why you can sit down in a 90°C sauna on a wooden bench but you would burn your bottom if those benches were metal or stone. And the same why your bathroom rug feels nice after taking a shower but the tiles feel painfully cold.,121.0,Other
1936,"Heat transfer is part of the answer. The other part is how much energy a material can hold.So, in ELI5 terms: think about a very small snowflake and a big cube of ice. When you touch the snowflake, you don't feel a temperature change. It has very little thermal mass, and absorbs heat only momentarily before becoming the same temperature as you. The ice cube on the other hand has quite a lot of thermal mass, so it will absorb your finger's heat for a lot longer, which makes you feel colder.Now, if instead of being the size of a snowflake, you have a material with a very low thermal mass but same size/mass as the ice cube. That object would feel completely indifferent to you, because it is incapable of absorbing much energy from you. Things like insulating foam have this property - it doesn't matter what temperature it is at, it is unable to absorb much energy from you.This is true for things at room temperature, not just colder or hotter things. For instance, if you touch something like a sheet of paper, you don't really feel much of a difference. On the other hand, if you touch the paper on top of a metal desk, you feel it is much colder now. The desk is now absorbing your heat along with the paper, and the desk has a higher thermal mass.Of course, this implies that you are at human temperature, which depending on your scale can be 10 to 30 degrees higher. In this case, you are hotter than room temp so everything around you will try to absorb your energy.If you are at the same temperature as everything else (so everything else is at human temperature), you will not feel any temperature by touching things, because they are at the same temperature as you.",41.0,Other

The second depends on how hard you push against it to make sure your not just near it but actually touching and some material characteristica.Air for example does not transfer heat well and therefore feels rather warm. Unless it is windy of course in which case the wind conducts the heat.Metal on the other hand conducts heat well and therefore rarely feels temperate. The range of temperatures that are neither hot nor cold is very small.Crystal lattices (gems) are more complicated and sometimes are more metalic and sometimes more like air depending on what kind of lattice you are talking about.Note that some things may feel too cold or hot at first but quickly normalize. They may have a small capacity when it comes to heat.,5.0,Other
1939,"The easy answer is that thermal conductivity is the reason. Metal feels cool to the touch because when you touch it it is able to take your heat energy away from you very quickly, wool, on the opposite end of the spectrum, isnt very good at taking thermal energy from something else, but the human body is pretty okay at it comparatively, which is why even if they have been in a cold room or outside it feels super comforting to put on a jacket.

1940,"a common misconception about heat and  temperature is that temperature is interchangeable with heat. In actuality, heat is the transfer of energy and when you feel a cool object, what you're feeling is heat transfer into the object. How much you feel is a property dependent on the heat conductivity of the material, not the actual temperature of the objects in question. When I taught introductory physics, we used to do an experiment with students where we took equal temperature ice cubes and put one on a metal slab and one on a block of wood. the ice melted on the metal much faster than the one on the wood despite both being at room temperature because metallic objects conduct heat easier than wood, and this is consequently why it feels cooler to touch than wood. This is also the reason why when stirring a pot of hot soup, you'd be smart to use a wooden spoon rather than a metal one, as the metal one would conduct heat easier and be likely to burn your hand.

1946,"1) The body's ability to determine temperature is relative.If you've ever had a fever, you might have gotten chills - that is because you were warmer, so the surrounding air was relatively colder.Similarly, if you keep your hand in warm water, the sensation of warmth will gradually vanish as your hand matches the water temperature. When you take your hand back out, the air should suddenly feel much colder than before until your hand cools back down.The same thing should happen when you get out of a warm bath or shower.Water tends to intensify the sensation of hot or cold because it has a very high specific heat capacity. That basically means that it takes more energy to change the temperature of water than to change the temperature of your skin, so hot water will ""stay hot"" while blasting energy into your skin, or cold water will ""stay cold"" while sucking out all your heat.2) Fluid temperature is not uniformClothing keeps you warm by isolating a pocket of air, which then warms up from body heat. Moving, especially opening the clothes, can let this air escape and a whole bunch of new, cold air will then replace it.Similarly, a human hand at rest in a body of water will be surrounded mostly by the particular water particles that have already imparted heat to (or taken heat from) the hand. Moving will then disrupt the water and introduce new, hotter or colder water particles to the skin, the same way that stirring food spreads the heat around more evenly.This ""water skin"" is so effective as a temperature barrier that it is possible to quickly slap a wet hand through molten metal or other stupidly hot substances without injury.

1970,"The simple answer is that the long term effects (over many many years) of consuming sweeteners instead of sugar has NEVER been scientifically tested in environments simulating real life consumption.Whilst it is true that cancer research institutes (as well as the EU and FDA) have publicly said that sweeteners have not been shown to cause cancer, the research they have done has some issues:There is no single long term study, and anybody who mentions that they have been ""heavily"" tested is really referring to volume of data rather than quality of studies. This means that the information is pieced together from multiple different sources, where nobody has followed the effects of consumption over a full lifetime.The safety tests conducted by regulators, such as the FDA, conduct the tests based on consumption of small amounts. This is to simulate what can be considered a ""health diet"". This means that a sweetener may be totally safe if you drink 1 diet soda in a given time frame, but they haven't even bothered to test what happens if you drink 10 of those diet sodas in the same amount of time. This is to say that the ""healthy diet"" the regulators are assuming is not necessarily the real world diet people are following.The studies conclude that they find no positive link between cancer and sweeteners. This is not the same as saying that it positively does NOT cause cancer, for the very reasons outlined above - the sweeteners have not been tested in every sense.Now you may think say that it is just a conspiracy that the FDA and EU etc. would tell you something is safe and it is not. However, it is only in recent history that both drinking and smoking were actively encouraged as part of a healthy lifestyle to achieve the goals of government and business.The other thing to consider when choosing sweeteners over sugar are the studies that show positive links between consuming sweeteners and overeating. There are two paths of thought on this one:A person knows that they are consuming less calories in a diet soda rather than with sugar. They think that this can balance out that extra bit of food they eat, and end up underestimating how much more they eat.The human body is programmed to begin the process of consuming sugar as soon as your tongue tastes something sweet.

2001,"There's a way in which this makes sense in photography. It has to do with ""color temperature"". This comes from incandescence, which is the property that things emit EM energy in a distribution of wavelengths that depend on its temperature. When things get hot enough, the amount and distribution of this energy starts moving into visible light. Basically, hot things glow. At around 1000-1500k things begin to glow visibly red. As temperature goes up, that glow brightens and moves more toward orange, then yellow, and eventually blue. Extremely hot things emit light primarily in UV and X-Ray wavelengths but still plenty of visible light, mostly in blue so that's what we see.When exposing a digital photograph, you typically have to set a white balance setting, which involves color temperature. You're telling the camera what temperature of incandescent light source to consider ""white light"". For example, if the scene is lit by standard incandescent light bulbs, we're talking around 3000K. But if it's direct sunlight, that's more like 6000K. Sometimes the light source isn't a natural incandescent source. On a cloudy day, the light takes on more of a bluish hue and simulates a color temperature closer to 8000K. Fluorescent bulbs throw everything off because their spectra aren't smooth and often throw of more green hues, but that's a different problem.If you set your camera to a high color temperature, say 8000K for a scene lit by incandescent bulbs, everything will take on a reddish-orange hue, because the camera is treating a more blue-oriented light as ""white"" and everything is lit by something that's more orange-red. So, this image is ""too warm"" -- the color temperature setting is too high for the scene.Conversely, if you set the camera to expose for incandescent lighting like 3000K but you're out shooting in sunlight or a cloudy day, it's expecting the ""white"" light level to be more orange-focused but instead there's a lot more blue, and so everything in the picture will take on a bluish hue. The image is ""cool"" because the color temperature setting is too low for the scene.",2.0,Other

Given that we know a probable speed and location, we can calculate a pretty good approximation of angular momentum (rotation speed of sorts).This is what we do for electrons. The difference is that while the ISS is definitely somewhere at space right now, electrons don’t really have a definite location or momentum before we observe them. So it’s kind of hard to say they are moving if they didn’t have a specific location to begin with.

This is because on a piano or a computer, every note must be produced at the same pitch every time so that the tuning can be ""good enough"" in every key. This means that all twelve tones are ""averaged"" in relation to the ""C"". Therefore, if someone is auto-tuned, singing along with computerized pitches, or singing along with a piano, they're technically perfectly ""in tune"" according to a tuner but they actually out of tune in relation to the key that they are singing in.If you google ""in tune third and fifth in comparison to a piano"" you'll find the first result explains it far better than I can.",140.0,Physics

If the only difference in a car crash is whether one car is stationary vs traveling at the other car, then the force will absolutely be greater. If the question is whether there is more force in a head on collision with another car or a car hitting a stationary, immovable wall, then there are certainly many more variables at play.It is simply not true that a car hitting a stationary car at 50 mph is the same force as those same two cars in a head on collision with both traveling 50 mph.",17.0,Physics

2125,"I think the most intuitive way to think about it is by thinking about symmetry. You have identical objects, each moving at 50 mph towards each other.

When they hit in front of you, everything on the left is exactly opposite everything on the right, the force and speed from one the same as the other, pushing against each other. Nothing can cross the exact middle, because that would require one to be pushing harder than the other. Because nothing crosses this plane through the middle, perpendicular to the objects, you could put an unmovable wall there and nothing would change. Each object can't tell if it hit a wall or another object going the opposite direction at the same speed. If the wall was a mirror, it would even look the same.",2.0,Physics

2131,"This very much depends on more information than you've given.Let's ignore all the details about crumple zones and small focused points of impact vs distributed impact and compression and decompression if materials, and assume we have cars whose front are just as flat and rigid as a wall.The force that is imparted on the car in the collision can be seen by the change in the cars velocity.A car going 50 that hits a wall and stops dead at the moment of impact has had enough force applied to it to reduce it's speed by 50.That's the same force of that car going 25 being hit so hard by an incoming car that it goes backwards 25mph for a moment.  Or a car going 100 running into something that instantly slows it down to 50.So two identical cars going 50 mph at each other will have the same impact on each other and will stop dead.  Each each suffers the exact same force as if they had hit an immovable wall.For extra fun, consider this -we've only been dealing with identical cars or super walls.  a massive truck can be going 25 and a small car going 50 that hits it head on might be thrown backwards - the truck might just be slowed down and not stop.

If the truck weighs 10x the car with velocity 1/2x the car, then the truck has 5x the momentum. This is enough to overcome the direction the car is moving and force it to go backwards. To find out how fast, you simply calculated the net momentum before the impact, then divide that by the truck and cars mass combined.",2.0,Physics

2141,"I'll expand on this a bit. RYB has the limitation that red and blue are (generally) very saturated colorants. Meaning, the lightest red you can make is still very much red. You can't really make a good magenta out of RYB colors, because the red is simply too strong.Magenta in this case is more or less a much less saturated red. Cyan is much less saturated blue. This means we can get lighter, brighter, and more vibrant colors. The addition of K (short for Key) black means we can get pure, dark blacks, with the extra benefit of not saturating the medium with a ton of CMY.CMYK can produce most colors the eye can see. RYB can, in turn, produce a large portion of the colors CMYK can.To frame it a different way, say your eye can see at 1080p; CMYK has a color resolution of 920p, where RYB is about 720p.Because the CMYK color space uses purer primary colors, it has a higher resolution to work in.",38.0,Physics

2143,"So why did we use Red Yellow Blue for so long? Because (a) for a long time we didn't know enough about light to know Cyan and Magenta are better primaries, and (b) Cyan and Magenta pigments are hard to make, requiring (relatively) modern processes.This is one of the reasons that Isaac Newton made his famous mistake of picking indigo as a defining color in the visible spectrum instead of cyan. ""Cyan"" didn't even become a term in English until the 1870s. Cyan pigment could technically be obtained before that, but it wasn't in any particular demand. Most people aren't aware that there's a big gap in the spectrum between green and blue and will tend to call cyan one or the other.",3.0,Physics

2148,"In the sock case the additional friction comes from surface tension of the water. This causes the sock to stick to your skin. People saying polarity of the water matter are implicitly implying that oil soaked clothing wouldn't stick to your skin which is untrue. But why does surface tension matter? When the sock is in contact with your skin water droplets bridge the gaps between the fabric and you. These bridges make capillary forces that attract you to the sock. These are the same forces that make wet sand stick to things. These forces also vanish when the contact is fully flodded (which is why you can't build an underwater sand castle and clothes don't stick to you underwater).In the case of the car, the scale has changed now the capillary forces are too small to be important compared to the other forces. In this case hydrodynamic forces (forces that move water about) dominate and these are enough to keep the surfaces separated. This means that there is no (or very little) actual surface contact and the friction is dominated by the viscosity of the fluid. Water has a low viscosity so the friction is also low.",866.0,Physics

2159,"Water is a polar molecule - one side electrically negative and the other positive. Because of its polarity, water likes to stick to other polar molecules, including itself. Your skin is somewhat polar, too, which is why sweat and water stick to it. A wet sock is a mesh filled with water, which then sticks to you.Furthermore, wet clothing isn't very permeable to air. It might be able to form a weak seal against your skin, if you squeeze any air underneath it out. That'll require extra force to break.Finally, wet clothing is considerably heavier than dry clothing. That may provide a higher normal force and thereby frictive force on the top of your foot.Instead of sliding your entire sock on, I suggest you smush your sock so it looks like a circle, place your toes in, and then roll the rest on like a wet, foot condom. Or forego wearing wet socks at all. They may lead to blisters....edit: Some comments.Morning has come and your replies showed me that I answered a different question. My b.

2214,"TL;DR: A loosely held paper edge has some thickness, so hits scissor blades with too many paper fibres at once and causes more of a crushing than cutting action; tight paper and scissors that are already traveling create lots-of-scissor-blade-edge-to-little-bit-of-fibre contact and replace that with clean, slicing force instead.- - -Take a really close look at paper and you'll see that it's made up of closely interwoven fibres. Better paper has more and longer fibres, but most of it is a mesh of randomly stuck-together incredibly thin pieces of, well, wood. And it has a little thickness to it, not much, but a little.So if you grab a pair of reasonably sharp scissors and put them at the edge of a piece of loosely held paper, there's not a very clean contact at that edge where the fibres of the paper move along the scissors' shearing edge to the point where they get cut. It's kind of like cutting steak by pressing your knife down on it instead of sawing; the meat gets squashed a little rather than severed because too many fibres in the meat are interacting with too little edge of your knife. Same with the paper because even though it's very thin, it still has SOME thickness to it. So it's hard to get your scissors and gliding motion started, and you end up with a crinkled little ripped area on your paper.Two ways to fix this are to hold the paper taut, so there's a very clean contact between both the top and bottom fibres at the paper's edge and the two cutting surfaces of the scissors, or to make a small cut and have the scissors build up some velocity and then carry that through into a glide. Either way causes the fibres at the top and bottom of the paper sheet to travel ALONG the cutting blade surfaces of the scissors while preventing too many fibres from jamming against the cutting surfaces all at once.Now you are getting LOTS of cutting surface handling a LITTLE bit of paper fibres at once, so they can slice rather than crush, and that's much much better for cutting. And then you get that satisfying whi-i-i-i-ish of the scissors travelling effortlessly in a perfect straight line, and the crowd goes wild!P.S. this is also why scissors with a little damage to the blades really suck at glide-cutting. Even the tiniest of dents in the cutting surface becomes a place where lots of fibres can clog up, and suddenly you're ripping things worse than a competitive event at an all-you-can-eat chili buffet.",3100.0,Physics

2232,"When you move fast (and by fast we talk about significant fractions of the speed of light -- 100mph isn't ""fast"" here), there are 2 things that happen:- for you, you experience time moving at the same rate you always experience time.  The second hand on your watch would still tick once a second.- for someone else who is standing still watching you, they see your time as going much slower than their time.  If they could see your watch, the second hand would be moving much slower.The faster you go, the slower your time appears to an observer looking at you.Interestingly, when you look at the person who is standing still, you will see their time as moving much slower too -- if you could see their watch, the second hand would also be going slow.  This is because, from your perspective, you are completely still and they are moving very fast.  (This is relativity)Time, speed, and relativity are interesting, but very strange, phenomena.One consequence of this is that anything that travels at the speed of light (a photon, for example) basically experiences no time passing.  So a photon that leaves a star 100 light years away would take 100 years to get here, as we would observe that photon.  From the photon's perspective, no time passed at all!",68.0,Physics

If you and your pal synced your watches, and then one of you went to travel at relativistic speeds for a while while the other stayed still, your clocks would show different time when you'd get back together.This logically means that when you look at the person who is standing still, you should observe their time going much faster than yours.

We might assume that to a stationary observer the light leaving the flashlight would appear to travel at 1.5 times the speed of light.  But this would be impossible because the speed of light is constant and can't be exceeded.The thing that has to alter to keep the speed of that light constant for all observers is time.  Our time would pass differently than the time of the stationary observer.",7.0,Physics

Common experience tells us that someone standing stationary at the side of the road will observe the overtaking car going at 60mph, whereas from your perspective it is going at 30mph.Now imagine that you are driving a car at 30mph (13.4m/s) and your shine a light. From your perspective the light is travelling at the speed of light ( 299 792 458 m/s). Common experience tells us that the person at the side of the road will see that light travelling at 30 mph + the speed of light (299 792 471 m/s). But that doesn't happen, both observers see the light travelling at the exact same speed (299 792 458 m/s). Einstein's theory says that the speed of light can never be broken no matter what frame of reference you measure it from. That means if someone is another car travelling at half the speed of light, the light shone is still travelling at 299792458 m/s relative to them.So how does this work? Well, speed is distance over time - so for speed to be fixed distance or time have to change within your frame of reference. Turns out both do depending on your reference frame. But for the car, time slows down relative to the guy who is stationary. The effect is very negligible until you reach speeds close to the speed of light.It's not just a theory, it's been verified using atomic clocks.As to how/why this works?

2262,"TL;DR: Your individual muscle cells are repeatedly contracting and relaxing and that burns energy.Ahh yes, the old physics class debate over the meaning of the word ""work"". The solution here is to realize that you actually are doing work when you try to move a wall, it just depends on the context you're looking at.  If you are looking at you and the wall, sure, you haven't done any work.  However, if you could look at your muscle fibers, you'd find that there's quite a bit of work going on.Skeletal muscles aren't like a hydraulic cylinder, they don't apply smooth, continuous force.  Instead, they're made up of groups of muscle cells often referred to as motor units that activate at different stages of the muscle contraction.  When your aren't fatigued, movement feels smooth, because all of the motor units are contracting in an overlapping fashion.  When you're pushing against an immovable object, however, your motor units will individually get fatigued quite quickly, and ""take turns"" dropping out, and then reactivating.  This means that even if your body isn't actually moving, your individual muscle fibers are using up energy contracting and then relaxing when they get fatigued, and then contracting again.  This is also the source of the shakiness you get if you try to lift too much.",33.0,Physics
2263,"This here is the right answer.All the ""elasticity"" ""distorting bones"" etc are misleading.

No great force is applied but fatigue quickly sets in. Continue to hold arm out and observe spasming as muscle failure sets in.",7.0,Physics

If you jump off the back of the car, the car is hurtling away from you, so the gap between you and the car is larger than it would be if the car were parked.  Since speed is distance divided by time and the moving car is your zero-point, your speed from the perspective of the car (that is, from the perspective that the car is actually perfectly still and it's the universe that's hurtling past at 30 km/s) will be faster when you jump off the rear of the car than when you jump off the front.",3.0,Physics

If the ship escapes earth then it will be orbiting the sun at a speed similar to earth.  If you  wish to go outwards in solar system (Mars and further) you would need to increase your orbital speed,  so you would have to thrust at such place that you escape earth orbit in the general direction of its orbit,  therefore at a greater orbital speed.If on the other hand you want to go to a lower sun orbit you need to decrease orbital speed therefore would accelerate your craft in such way that you escape earth orbit in three opposite direction if it's orbit around the sun.",2.0,Physics

Since your orbit is now referenced to the sun then burning the engine in the same direction of Earth's orbit gives you a 40 km/s head start. If you tried to get to Mars by burning the opposite direction you first need to slow down 40 km/s, then speed back up by 40 km/s, then add the energy to get you out to Mars's orbit.

Like a hot air balloon, the hot mixture gets pushed up above that cooler surrounding air and rises. The atmosphere gets thinner as you go up, so even though it's cooler up there it's less dense. Eventually, the atmosphere will be less dense than the hot explosion mixture, which means the mixture can't rise anymore. It hits this ""cap"" of thin air and spreads out. Think of it like releasing a big bunch of balloons in a room, and when they hit the ceiling the ones on the bottom push the ones on top out of the way.The ground is also still really hot from the explosion so as cool air rushes in to fill the space left by the hot air it gets heated by the ground and gets pushed up, too. As it does, it carries more ash and dust with it, creating the thin column of the ""mushroom"", squeezed inward by the cool air all around it.That hot column of air keeps pushing up, forcing the hot gas mixture already up there out of the way. The mixture cools off, too, which makes it begin to sink back down a little.

That's because when detonated on the ground the neutrons generated in the reaction as the bomb explodes activates a lot of ground debri and material making it radioactive. That now radioactive debri then gets spread over a wide area by the blast. Since the material was activated it tends to have a very short half-life, increasing the radiation hazard a lot.

2315,"The Earth’s magnetic field is dynamic - that is, it is in a constant state of being created and does not remain static like the magnetic field of a bar magnetic does if left undisturbed. This is reflected in what we have chosen to call the phenomenon which generates it, the ‘geodynamo’. Essentially, the geodynamo is generated by the movement of turbulent currents in the outer core, as the outer core is molten metal and the movement of electrically conductive material in this way can generate a magnetic field (electricity and magnetism are different sides of the same coin, the fundamental force of nature which describes them is the combination of both of them - electromagnetism).So variations in the movement and patterns of flow in the outer core are what leads to variation in the exact position of the magnetic poles and the apparent polar wander that you ask about. There is even enough variation that the magnetic poles can periodically flip so that the Earth has reversed polarity until such a flip occurs again. It should be stressed that such pole reversals are not at regular intervals and so given that we also have a relatively poor understanding of fluid flow in the outer core, we have no way to predict such occurrences.

When we talk about magnetic poles we are ignoring the part of the loop that goes through the magnetic object. It comes from an earlier model of magnetism, which gives the wrong answer for magnetic fields inside things, but works pretty well outside things.This neat diagram shows how the Earth's magnetic field lines work; they go through the middle of the Earth, out in the Southern Hemisphere, and loop around to go back into the Earth in the Northern Hemisphere. [The ""g"" poles are the geographic poles, so due to the Earth's rotation, and the ""m"" ones are the magnetic poles.]The exact shape of this field depends on the structure of all the stuff inside the Earth (which is generating this field); but a lot of that stuff is in liquid form (or, at least, has liquidy properties) so moves around, and that causes shifts in the field lines. They sort of flow around.So what do we mean by a ""magnetic North pole"" given that there aren't really magnetic poles, just loops?The Magnetic North Pole is defined as the point on the Earth's surface where the magnetic field lines are travelling straight down into the ground (not at some angle). If you held a magnet there, the North part of it would point straight down. Anywhere else it would be slightly tilted. [Note - this means the magnetic North pole is actually a magnetic ""south"" pole - i.e. a thing that north poles are attracted to.]As the inside of the Earth moves around a bit, its magnetic field will shift, and so this point will flow around a bit. It used to be around Canada, but in the last few years has moved close to the geographic North, and is now heading off towards Russia.We can define the ""magnetic South pole"" in a similar way (the point on the Earth's surface where magnetic field lines go straight up), but there is no reason why it should be directly opposite to the magnetic North pole; they're actually a bit off as the field isn't symmetric.There are also the geomagnetic North and South poles. If we pretend the Earth's magnetic field is caused by a bar magnet (it isn't, but we can approximate it), those are where we would put the ends of the bar magnet.Having said that, the Earth's magnetic field is quite a bit more complicated (that is a computer model of the magnetic field).If you are interested. Wikimedia has some handy maps (from 2014 - so out of date now) showing how the magnetic field strength varies across the Earth's surface (stronger near the poles, weaker near the Equator), how the inclination of the field varies (0 degrees is where the field is perfectly horizontal, 90 degrees where it is vertical - so at the magnetic poles), and how the declination of the field varies (so how wrong your compass is - the angle between the direction a compass would point and the geographic North or South pole; 0 degrees it is pointing in the right direction).",2.0,Physics

2347,"It seems that when astronomers talk about Jupiter’s radiation, the concept tends to be misconstrued a bit because it's not really the planet that emits the deadly particles. A planet rather traps the highly energetic particles be it from the Sun or other interplanetary surroundings. Every planet with an active magnetic field, including Earth, traps highly energetic particles within the “belts” of the magnetic field since the magnetic filed flows out of the convective core in sort of paths, or belts. At some points of the magnetic field, the charged particles either from the Sun or whatever else they come from, get trapped. The fact that they get trapped doesn't change the fact that they can destroy any biological system or man made electronic devices.Jupiter’s magnetic filed is the largest out of all the planets in the solar system. He's a giant after all :-) he probably has a huge metallic hydrogen core (still a mystery). His magnetosphere extends millions of kilometers into space all the way to Saturn on one end and millions of kilometers in other directions. It's because Jupiter’s magnetic field is so intense, which would not be that dangerous in on itself, much greater amount of the deadly charged particles get trapped be it from the Sun or Io’s volcanic activity. Those particles literally keep accumulating and residing within the Jupiter’s magnetic fields forming the so-called radiation belts.",70.0,Physics

2365,"It's not just as simple as more energy = goes through more stuff. It's a Goldilocks and the Three Bears example of this radiation is too big and slow and this radiation is too small and fast. Gamma rays, visible light, and radio waves are all examples of electromagnetic radiation, and  you're right that radio waves (with a wavelength of meters), are much less energetic than visible light (with a wavelength of around 5 x 10^-7 meters).Three things happen to EM radiation when it encounters a barrier.  It can bounce ( reflectance or scattering), pass through (transmittance), or just plain stop (absorbance).The intensity of radiation transmitted depends on several things:The wavelength of the radiationThe intensity of the radiation hitting the barrierThe chemical composition of the barrierThe physical microstructure of the barrierThe thickness of the barrierYour question has to do with #1, but keep in mind that powerful enough visible light (many times  brighter than sunlight) would be able to pass through the walls of your home so you could see it, and even a weak light can shine through a paper-thin wall or a wall made of glass. Now as for your question, imagine an ant and an elephant standing next to each other.  The ant doesn't know the elephant is there because it's too big and the elephant doesn't know the ant is  there because it's too small.  EM waves interact with matter in a similar way:  on their own scale of size and time.The reason why visible light can't travel through walls as easily as gamma rays or radio waves is because, to the visible light, there's something 'there' on a similar scale of length (wavelength) and time (frequency) that the gamma rays are too small and fast to interact with and the radio waves are too large and slow to interact with. The gamma rays just pass through the spaces between and within atoms and molecules. They're small enough to do that. If your walls were made of pure lead, they'd have a little more trouble. The radio waves on the other hand are large enough to ignore the walls because they're too thin. But if you've ever tried to listen to a radio in a tunnel or a cave, you know that radio waves have  trouble penetrating through meters of earth.Visible light interacts with many solid materials because the wavelengths are the right size to be scattered by structural elements within those materials like microfibers and cracks and porous spaces.  Well-cut glass or diamond don't have these structural elements at this length scale so they look clear unless they're shattered or rough. So scattering due to physical elements of the right size is a major reason, but another factor contributes too.Visible light also interacts with pigments in the paint on surface of your wall.  This occurs  because the pigment molecules have chemical bonds within them that only vibrate at certain  frequencies. When visible light at that frequency hits the molecule, it's absorbed.  The frequency of radio waves is far too low to interact with these kinds of vibrations.",74.0,Physics

2371,Note that Hubble's Law isn't the Doppler effect (a frequency shift from objects moving away).  It's the expansion of space itself causing the redshift.

The age is mostly incidental, and is brought up in pop-science articles because people really like the geewiz factor of ""The light from this star is [x] years old!"" Its really only relevant for distant galaxies that are so old that the conditions of the universe were significantly different, several billion years or more. For instance, our neighboring galaxy Andromeda is ~2.5 million light-years away. That sounds far, but 2.5 million years is practically ""instant"" on astrophysical time scales.",36.0,Physics

So astronomers can look at a galaxy's spectrum, find the emission and absorption peaks of different elements, see how much they've shifted, and then apply Hubble's Law to that shift to figure out how far away that galaxy is.For close objects, light ""age"" is known from a distance measurement, as Charyou-Tree said.",7.0,Physics

2382,"To add to the methods mentioned:They also use a certain type of stars called Cepheids. These are stars that pulsate perdiodically. Lucky for us, the period of the star and its absolute brightness are linearly connected. So by measuring the light we can get the period, from which we can derive the absolute brightness (that is the brightness of the star when it would be at 10 parsec away from us.) As we know how light diminishes with distance, we can calculate the distance if we know the measured and the absolute brightness.This follows the following formula:Measured brightness-absoluye brightness=5*log(d)-5A next method is using a nearby supernova/ the supernova of the star. Of type Ia to be exact. Because supernovae of that type always emit practically the same amount of light, we again know the absolute brightness. As these things are WAY brighter than regular stars, we can use them across greater distances.

The how is simple and explained by Newtonian Gravity or General Relativity.  But I think they're actually asking ""Why does mass have anything to do with gravity?""What's the difference?  How seeks to understand the mechanism by which something happens: how to measure and predict results. Why seems to understand the purpose by which something happens: what is the motivation of the creator(s) when they decided to make it this way.How is science.  Why is religion.How - the answer is we've measured that anything with mass has a gravitational effect.  We can predict how it affects other things with mass and have gotten very good at predicting what will happen.  We have explored for some underlying ""simpler"" mechanism but have not found any.  As far as we can tell: more mass makes more gravity and that's the way the universe works. (ok keeners, yes enough energy can also cause gravity but let's keep it ELI8-ish).Unsatisfying?

/*# sourceMappingURL=IdCard.85bee69f2f559267015c.css.map*/The earth is only in orbit because of the sun's gravity. It is slowly pulling earth towards it only being held back by the forward momentum of the earth. However, the sun is not pulling the earth towards itself because the sun is burning trillions of tons of gas every day and is therefore losing alot of mass, which brings me to next part. Things with less mass have less 'gravity' or a lower tendency to pull things towards it.You can use g=GM/r² to find how strong the gravitational field strength of an object is. G is a gravitational constant which doesn't change, m is mass and r is the radius of said object. So the higher the mass, the stronger the gravity.",58.0,Physics
2395,"However, the sun is not pulling the earth towards itself because the sun is burning trillions of tons of gas every day and is therefore losing alot of mass,Just a small quibble here.  The mass loss of the sun is not the primary reason the planets don't move toward the sun.  The primary reason is that they are in stable orbits.  They are moving tangential to their orbits fast enough  that they don't get closer to the sun on average.",87.0,Physics

2404,"It you let some helium out, it will get lighter because helium has mass.  However, it will also become smaller, which will cause it to displace less air.  It's displacement of air with a lighter gas that allows the helium balloon to float.",16.0,Physics
2405,"The balloon gets lighter. But I think you need to compare this to other things based on the same principle: boats and hot air balloons.Keep in mind that a hot air balloon used to lift people off the ground is also VERY heavy. Adding hot air to it doesn't change that. What matters is that the weight of the air it displaces is more than the balloon's (plus the basket and riders) weight, so it floats.When the weight of a boat is less than the weight of the water it's displaced, the boat floats. If the boat shrinks a LOT but weight ''slightly'' less, it will have a net sinking effect because it's displaced less water, but not enough to make up for the weight reduction.A small helium balloon shrinks and gets lighter, but now the ratio of weight to the balloon's rubber to helium goes in favour of the balloon rubber which is much heavier than air. The balloon will begin to sink, or at least not float as easily.",2.0,Physics
2406,"It's like deflating a ball.  It would be lighter (less weight) but also A LOT less buoyant (it would sink in water).  Balloons ""float"" in air the same way that a ball floats in water.",2.0,Physics
2407,"Helium is light than air. Thats what make balloon float.WEIGHT is Mass X Graity, however, because helium is lighter than air, it counteracts some weight by providing a upward force thus making the ballon lighter despite a bigger mass.As helium runs out of the balloon, air doesn't enter, thus the lift force gets smaller and smaller, and the actual weight of the rubber part starts to return to normal.",5.0,Physics
2408,"This is all wrong. An inflated balloon would have more mass and more weight than a deflated balloon. Helium does not provide an upward force, and even if it did, providing an upward force does not make something lighter or heavier.",3.0,Physics

2415,"The planets do lie, more or less, in the same plane around the sun, because they all formed from the same disk of dust rotating around the sun.The depiction of electrons in an atom is a convention, and not even a consistent one - actual electrons do not orbit the nucleus in any of the depicted ways because they’re not little tiny balls of matter moving around. Electrons form a “cloud of probabilities” , basically areas around the nucleus where electrons can be, and electrons of a certain energy will form different “cloud” shapes.",15.0,Physics
2416,"Well and the idea of electron “orbitals” is also based on mutual repulsion by electrons and attraction to the central nucleus.  So, proponents had to come up with a system that demonstrated maximal separation of electrons from each other, while keeping electrons in the same orbitals at the same distances from the nucleus.Planets have a different set of entering arguments.",2.0,Physics
2417,"Well before being a disk of dust around the sun, it was a 3d cloud. But any system in the universe has its own angular momentum conserved, and due to frictions and interactions, ends up ""flattening"" in the plane perpendicular to this axis.",0.0,Physics
2419,"This image is a more accurate depiction of what we see when we look at electrons ""orbiting"".  Notice that there are multiple electrons per orbital layer, and they don't ""orbit"", but more like ""can be found in that orbital if you look"".One reason for ""why"" is that we have completely different methods for ""seeing"".Planets are controlled by gravity, and we look at them with electromagnetism (light).  Looking at planets doesn't disturb the orbits of the planets.The electrons orbit because of electromagnetism (which, by the way, has electro force and magnetic force), and we look at electrons with electromagnetism.  And actually, we ""look"" by bombarding the whole atom with photons or electrons that have significant energy and will definitely disrupt the electrons we're observing.  So you get a ""cloud"" of probability where the electron WAS at the time when you bombarded and totally disrupted the atom, after statistically adding together the positions after you've looked at millions of atoms.And the other reason is that it's not just the way we look, but the rules are actually different.  Planets are governed by gravity and behave as particles; subatomic particles behave as particles AND waves, and are governed by forces, the Uncertainty Principle, and Pauli's Exclusion Principle, and interactions between subatomic particles aren't the same as collisions between planets.The (physics) rules are different.",3.0,Physics
2421,"Basically our solar system started out as a cloud and spun around until it was flattened like a disc. Thus why it looks like the planets are orbiting on an even plane.Electrons deal with charges and have energy that propels them to infinitely move up, but at the same time infinitely move down thus why they never close the distance around a nuclei.",0.0,Physics
2422,"So I know a very little about this, but maybe enough to be helpful: basically, the orbit of planets has to do with how solar systems are formed.Here’s my understanding: before a solar system is a solar system, it’s just a giant cloud of gas and dust in space. Not like a star, which is more-condensed gas — actually, I think these clouds of gas come from some kind of novas (when stars die and explode). Anyway. All the particles in the cloud are close enough on a cosmic scale that they eventually clump together into larger and larger stuff until you get planets and a star, I guess. But here’s where the motion comes in. All the particles of gas and dust have some amount of motion to them; I guess stars are usually spinning before the nova? So. All these particles are moving. Any kind of circular motion in the cloud due to the movement of these particles is going to continue to be exhibited no matter what happens within the system: if the whole thing is spinning, it stays spinning overall, even if the tiny particles group together. So while it’s just a bunch of dust and gas, this cloud has an opportunity to balance out any errant directions so that the whole thing is moving on pretty much the same plane. You don’t have wonky orbits because the cloud phase causes any odd directions to average out until one dominant alignment remains.Hope that makes sense! Atoms are super complicated and I have no idea why they orbit or if it’s even accurate to use the word “orbit” because that stuff gets all weird and probability-oriented when you really get into it.",0.0,Physics
2423,"I""m not sure I understand the question fully to be honest. To give you a background I am a masters student in engineering physics, applied physics. I have a relative good understanding of what's going on in both models. First there are a few problems with your statement, to begin with all planets are not in a perfect plane. Of course it's a very small difference but it exist. When you mean they behave differently, in what way do you mean? The two systems have two fundamentally different forces acting on each particle in the system if that's what you're wondering. Mainly it's the electromagnetic force acting on the electrons and gravity on the planets. Then it's also the effect of electrons and nuclei not behaving strictly as a particle as they behave much like waves at that scale as well.Tl;dr: is it possible to rephrasr or be more specific in what it is that you mean? It's fundamentally two different system, their orbits are due to all forces acting radially in laymens terms/simplified.",-3.0,Physics

2425,"Basically I mean why do electrons orbit all around the nucleus in the electron cloud, and why is it not the same for planets orbiting the sun?

2439,"Without running, you are correct that your maximum height is limited to the vertical energy your legs can produce. But, if you start by running, you create a fair amount of kinetic energy, albeit in a horizontal direction. Nevertheless, at the end of the run, when your legs generate vertical force, a fair amount of the horizontal kinetic energy is redirected vertically. This redirected energy is added to the leg-based vertical energy, producing more height.",8.0,Physics
2442,"One way that your forward momentum helps during a high jump (as in the track & field event, not just a jump that is high) is that it carries you over the bar quicker (see my other comments in this thread). This alone would provide a benefit. It wouldn't actually contribute to the height of your jump, but it would allow you to jump over a higher bar due to your more efficient (flatter) trajectory.But is that all there is to it? Or can some of the horizontal momentum actually be converted to vertical momentum?Momentum or kinetic energy certainly can be redirected this way in other settings. E.g. if you drive a car at speed towards a ramp, the ramp can launch you upwards (even if you take your foot of the accelerator when you hit the ramp). Or think of a ski jumper doing a similar thing. Clearly rolling and gliding motion can be redirected from a horizontal (or even downward) direction to an upward direction. This redirection is mediated by the normal force of the surface that you're rolling or gliding on. You're pushing down on it and it pushes back with the same force. This slows down your motion perpendicular to the surface, but also accelerates you in the direction parallel to the surface. In ideal circumstances you could convert all your energy to a perpendicular direction, but in practice you will lose some.So, you need some force to convert horizontal into vertical energy. But how can you get this while running on a flat surface? This is where tendons come in. Tendons can store energy, a bit like a spring or rubber band. Every time you land while running, some energy is stored inside the tendons in your legs, which is released when you push off for the next stride. This helps you to run faster and more efficiently. Now if, instead of another running stride, your next move is a jump, that stored up energy can be redirected upwards rather than forwards, which gives you a bit of extra height.",2.0,Physics

You can make two dots on a deflated balloon and as you blow it up, the dots don't necessarily move, but the space between them gets bigger. The further apart you make the dots, the bigger the space between them will be when the balloon is fully inflated.So objects that are huge distances away, like other galaxies that are hundreds of millions or billions of lightyears away, have a huge amount of space expanding in between them, and with enough distance that expansion can appear to be moving them faster than the speed of light, creating a universe that is far bigger than light has had time to travel.",2.0,Physics

And then, when you use the compressed air, it gets cold again. Try using an air tool for more than a few seconds and feel just how cold it gets...As you go higher, air pressure drops because there's less air above you pushing down on you.

So less heat transfer, and it feels colder.Think of something like a bunch of marbles bouncing around. Any time a marble bumps into something, it gives off heat energy.

You're treating a person holding a heavy object the same as a table holding up an object, but tables aren't living organisms and don't require energy.

Work is just a force over distance, you still use energy in other ways.When you hold an object your muscle are creating a force to counter gravity. Gravity have an acceleration of 9.81 and compare that to a car which can have an acceleration of 4 or more. Basically, human can't really push something at an acceleration of 9.81 so you usually gonna need more strenght to hold something than to push it. Now of course, when you push you also have to work against gravity indirectly. Gravity will increase friction with the ground and so depending on the surface you might have an harder time pushing something. That said, usually people push things on lower friction surface, nobody want to push on stricky ground.In addition, holding stuff isn't really efficient. When you push you can put your weight behind and with big things you can align your force with the geometric center for the object, which is a very efficient way to use your strenght. If you do it right you can use your legs and back, which are a lot stronger than your arms.When you hold stuff like I said it's really inefficient. You use your arm and you rarely hold stuff over your head, because that's dangerous. So you don't just push, the force is applied (your hand) away from your anchor (your shoulder), and this distance is, the more strenght your need to counter the force of gravity put on the object your are holding.

2573,"The people saying helicopters are less stable or inherently less safe than fixed-wing aircraft (planes) are mistaken. Autorotation (described by /u/jacklychi) allows helicopters to make controlled landings without an engine very easily, and helicopters get just as many safety inspections as any other aircraft, more or less, if they are for commercial transportation.The biggest difference is that helicopters are used primarily for low, short flights between nearby destinations. Autorotation requires a certain height above the ground in order to work - that means if a helicopter loses and engine it's safer if you're higher up. Except that most helicopters are flying lower to the ground. That makes autorotation more difficult. And since helicopters are usually flying over populated areas it's less likely that a helicopter will be able to find a clear, open place to land. Although autorotation allows a helicopter to land safely if it has a place to land, they still don't have glide slopes - you're not going to get very far, only straight down. A plane will be flying probably much higher and although a landing without an engine is more dangerous, they will at least have more energy and lift to travel horizontally to a safer, emptier place.The tendency for helicopters to be used for lower, shorter flights also puts them closer to obstacles like power lines, buildings, birds, and even tall trees. In the case of the Kobe crash, it crashed into a hillside. Visibility was poor. Although the cause has not yet been determined, it could be as simple as the pilot misread the instruments and didn't see the hillside until it was too late to avoid it. Compare that to most passenger planes which would be flying so high that not being able to see the terrain isn't an issue, because there isn't any. I have zero other information, I'm not saying that was the cause, I am only suggesting that it could be a cause which is generally not true of most commercial passenger flights.The other problem is that helicopters are more likely to be privately owned and operated, at least compared to big passenger planes. Those are regulated very strictly. Although any flights are very regulated, a small for-hire helicopter service may not have the same stringency applied to it as other modes of air travel. This is also true of small planes, too, and one of the reasons they tend to crash more often than big passenger planes.",3.0,Physics

The first photons generated by humanity were from fire, which is in the visible and IR. Took us hundreds of thousands of years to get to much longer wavelengths (radio). We had X-rays in the 1800s, but took to the 20th century to reliably make UHF radio.It's really about what phenomena generate photons in each portion of the EM Spectra. Some of those are easier for us to do than others. Read the Wikipedia page on the EM Spectrum for more info there: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrumVery broadly, everything in the ""radio"" side of the spectrum can be generated electrically, requiring electronics at higher frequencies due to the need for smaller components. Towards the optical regime (IR, visible, x-ray), you rely on atomic transitions, which is a totally different way of making photons.",7.0,Physics

2613,"If you're solely concerned about producing them, then the actual mechanism for producing the light is the real problem. For radio waves, we typically produce these by running a current back and forth in a wire. How fast the current goes back and forth determines the frequency/wavelength of the light. The faster the back and forth, the shorter the wavelength. It is quite difficult to force currents to do this back and forth fast enough to produce short-wavelength light.Incandescent light bulbs produce visible light by heating something up enough to where it glows a specific color. To get e.g. UV light, you would have to heat something up CRAZY hot, which is not really feasible for both energy consumption reasons and also because many materials would just burn up at these temperatures.Now, an alternative is to shoot an electron beam into a series of magnetic fields where each new magnetic field is in the opposite direction of the last. You can then tune the strength of the magnetic fields and the speed of the electrons to produce a similar ""back and forth"" effect but at much higher rates. This is how a typical X-ray machine works.For even higher wavelengths like gamma rays, you can use particle collisions to produce them. For example, a PET scan works by putting a radioactive dye into your blood. The blood carries the radioactive particles all around your body, where they decay into something else by emitting an antimatter electron (called a positron). Since your body is FULL of electrons, this positron very quickly finds one and when matter meets antimatter, they annihilate, in this case producing two hard X-ray/gamma ray photons which can be detected by the machine.",2.0,Physics
2614,"It can be a bit counter-intuitive at first, given how most interactions in everyday life need some direct interaction between objects, but gravity exists between any 2 objects that have mass, even if they aren't in any sort of direct contact otherwise.The force of gravity between objects decreases at an inverse square of the distance between them(meaning, we divide by an ever larger number), but never by a flat amount, so it simply never reaches 0.How it's theoretically possible for such a thing to even exist? That's maybe more of a philosophical question, we observed it to be this way consistently, and doesn't contradict anything we've seen, so we kind of just have to assume that it's possible.In practice however, because the force becomes really really weak really fast with distance, you get interactions where the force of gravity is effectively meaningless in extreme distances.

If you are talking about 1 meter per second per second you are talking about the acceleration or the rate at which a speed changes.Another way of saying ""per second per second"" would be to say ""per second squared"" or just  ""s-2"".",2.0,Physics
2701,"Perhaps it is more helpful to look at it more generally:Measurements have units. There are many different units, so for example you can measure time in seconds, minutes, hours, days, years, etc. Similarly, you can measure distance in kilometres, centimetres, inches, you name it.To avoid confusion, and to make sure people speak in the same language using the same units, we have developed an international system of units (called SI from the French name) which is intended to be the ""basic"" system of measurement. (Disclaimer: Other systems are used and I pass no judgment on whether one is better than the others...)There are seven base units, which are:kilogramme (kg) for masssecond (s) for timemetre (m) for lengthampere (A) for electric currentKelvin (K) for temperaturemole (mol) for the amount of ""stuff"" you have (physical substance)candela (cd) for how much light there is (intensity of light)Everything else is derived from these units.So how does that help with your question? Well, the metre per second square (or metre per second per second) is the SI unit for acceleration. Let's break it down into the base units:Imagine you want to measure a car's speed, and you want to express it in SI units. To explain speed to someone you say that the car moved X metres (distance) in Y seconds (time).So your unit for speed is X (m) / Y(s) = m/s or metre per second. The way to look at it is that units in the SI system form part of the equation, so if you divide metres by seconds, your result is in m/s.Now, let's imagine you want to know what the car's acceleration was. What is acceleration? Acceleration is the rate of change of speed over time.In very basic terms, if you have a car going from a dead stop (0 m/s) to a speed of 1 m/s (so in one second it has moved one metre), you calculate the average acceleration of the car as:speed / time interval, which is (1 m/s) / (1 s) - this gives you a result in m/s/s or m/s2TLDR: The SI unit of acceleration is m/s2, sometimes called metre per second per second. It measures the change in speed per time interval, and speed is measured in m/s, so change in speed over time is measured in m/s per second or m/s/s.",2.0,Physics
2707,"There's a lot of space in ""matter"".The atoms in a solid may look like this, but for liquids and gases they are a lot more spaced apart.  Gases can compress because of the spaces between the atoms.Inside the atom, there is also a lot of space.  If you overcome the electromagnetic forces that keep the electrons orbiting the nucleus, the reduction in size can be 10,000x or more.The nucleus is formed of protons and neutrons, and they are formed of smaller particles called quarks, with, again, a much smaller size than the actual proton or neutron that they form.  So if you could overcome the nuclear forces that give the nucleus its shape, you could again ""collapse"" to much smaller sizes.So what happens is, gravity is usually the force that can ""concentrate"" to such intensities to override the other forces.  You can see here that these forces are much stronger than gravity, but gravity can increase if you concentrate more matter, to the point where it can overcome these forces.So, as the atoms are squeezed closer together by gravity, at some point the electromagnetic force that keeps the electrons in place is overcome, and the star compresses to become a neutron star, sort of like one giant ball of just neutrons, like a nucleus but huge.  A neutron star would be the mass (and gravity) of the Sun, compressed to the size of a city.With more material added, gravity increases, and perhaps the neutrons inside the neutron star compress to form a quark star.If more material is added, and gravity increases more, we basically run out of forces to oppose it; electromagnetism and nuclear forces have already been overcome, and we don't know of any other forces with our current understanding of physics, so in theory gravity would be ""unopposed"" and would compress the matter down to zero size.  A ""singularity"", a point.We don't know what that looks like, and this theory is considered ""correct"" because we haven't discovered any other forces that could stop the process.",4.0,Physics

2710,"Wasn't going to answer, but a lot of these answers are missing the main point.The point of an an engine is to shoot gas out the back as fast as possible. The faster the gas goes, the more thrust per mass you get.For gas flows below the speed of sound, increasing the pressure makes them faster. All nozzles, jet or rocket, will include a section that decreases in size. This accelerates the gas until it reaches the speed of sound, and for most jet engines that's all that we do.However, rocket engines really need more thrust per mass of gas expelled, because every gram of gas expelled takes up space in a very limited fuel tank, so they accelerate the gasses even more, using what is called a de Laval nozzle (converging-diverging).For supersonic flows, the effect of pressure changes. Now, low pressures make the gas go faster, so we expand the gas as much as possible as soon as our flow reaches the ""throat"", where the gas flow reaches the speed of sound.Of course, we can't expand the gas until it has lower pressure than the atmosphere, because then the atmosphere kind of pushes back into the nozzle, and we can get some really weird shockwave-type effects. But that's talk for another day.",168.0,Physics

2716,"Isn’t there also a requirement to make sure the exhaust gasses move as much as possible in the direction opposite to the direction of travel? In (near vacuum), a lot of exhaust from a small nozzle (engine bell) would expand outwards, thus losing efficiency. By using a larger bell, the exhaust pressure is reduce and as such, the reduced expansion increases efficiency.",2.0,Physics

From their point of view, they will see the ball travel diagonally upwards as the ball has a different horizontal velocity to them.If we go into extra detail with this we end up with special relativity (which can get pretty confusing at times but I think it's cool)Hope this helps!

2729,"In physics, and life in general, there are things called reference frames.  You make the measurements and stuff within the reference frame.  If things worked out the way you're thinking, you'd also have to account for the rotation of the Earth along with the rotation of the Earth around the sun in terms of the velocity.  I mean, technically, we're all moving that fast and because of that, you just treat it as zero.Now, if you were in an open car, the object thrown would start encountering wind resistance and would hit you in the face because you're still going that fast, while the object isn't.  That's why when you throw something out the window, it doesn't continue going as fast as the car.  Within the car, everything is already going as fast as the car and no outside force is being exerted on anything to affect its acceleration and trajectory.

2737,"Yeah, basically.A sphere is the most stable shape since it has the most even distribution of matter and pressure and it's the closest to equilibrium matter can be in.  Imagine if the world was a cube.  The outer corners of the cube would be further away from the earth's core, and therefore experience less gravitational pull than the center of the faces of the cube.  This means there's a differential, and nature doesn't like things to be different.Big accumulations of matter tend to spin due to conservation of angular momentum, and tend to be spherical due to tendency toward equilibrium.",5.0,Physics
2738,"Many good explainations, but I'll add mine.Yes, gravity.If a planet is not round, it means that some parts of its surface are farther away from its center than other parts. That is a way of saying that these parts stand ""higher"" on the surface than what surrounds them, like for example a mountain. Due to gravity, that part will then fall down, until it gets to the same altitude as the rest around it. Eventually, all parts making the surface are at the same height, and nothing can fall any further down. Because everything is the same altitude (distance from center), that's a way to say the planet is now round.That applies to every body in space, but it depends on how strong gravity is on it (bigger body =stronger gravity), and how hard is its crust. A liquid planet will always be very round, as nothing can not fall down closer to the center, if there is anywhere to fall.  A rocky smallish planet like Earth can have a few mountains standing up, making it a bit less round. An astetoid has very little gravity and it's rock-hard, so it can be very far from round.Plus, spinning make planets a bit flat, like when a pizza maker spins the pizza over his head to flatten it, but just a tiny bit. Earth is a bit ""wider"" at the equator than it is ""tall"", unlike a perfect sphere.",3.0,Physics

2775,"Imagine a room full of mouse traps covering every inch of the floors and walls, even hanging from the ceiling, all armed and ready to spring. All that energy locked and loaded and just waiting for something to start the reaction.You toss a golf ball in the room and then quickly close the door and as the first mousetraps go off, they fly around, landing on other traps, which sets off other traps, and you have an exponential chain reaction. The more mousetraps go off, the more mousetraps want to go off. At a certain point in this faster and faster triggering of the traps, they pretty much all go off at the same time. You've just started a nuclear meltdown because the reaction was allowed to go as fast as it could without any control. If you took the room itself and crushed it down to a smaller size so that all the mouse traps were touching each other and could go off even faster, that is like what a nuclear bomb does. The conditions are so perfect, that the chain reaction takes place instantly.Now imagine that you had pillows you could drop in from the ceiling that slowed down how quickly the mouse traps could go off, slowing it down. The more pillows, the slower the reaction, but too many pillows and the mouse traps would just stop, but too few and they would exponentially trigger out of control. There is a sweet spot where the mouse traps go off continuously, but at a controlled rate, this is what nuclear reactor designs strive for but using control rods instead of pillows, and Uranium 235 instead of mouse traps.The uranium decays releasing neutrons which can strike other uranium atoms, making it more likely they will decay, which releases more neutrons, like the mouse traps going off faster and faster. By inserting neutron absorbing control rods around these uranium fuel rods, you can slow down the reaction, or even stop it all together. Every time the uranium decays, you get neutron radiation, heat, and decay elements being created. By collecting this heat with molten salts or water, they can drive steam turbines just like other power plants, and generate electricity.Contrast this with a nuclear bomb which has the uranium (lets just assume it's a U235 bomb) packed in so tightly and compressed by conventional explosives that it immediately goes into a chain reaction, exponentially ramping up in the form of an explosion. Because the uranium is explosively compressed, it's so dense, and packed in so tight, that it's like a super mouse trap room where all the conditions are perfect for the chain reaction to speed up as quickly as possible.",7.0,Physics

2778,"There's two very big differences between a nuclear reactor and a nuclear bomb (and a huge number of small differences, but let's focus on the big differences).Fast neutrons vs thermal neutrons.Neutrons are the secret sauce that makes atom splitting possible. Simply put, atoms of all kinds tend to absorb spare neutrons from their surroundings. In the case of atoms of nuclear fuel, these extra neutrons interrupt the structure of the atom so much that the atoms simply fall apart (ie split). In a way, nuclear fuel atoms are like a human pyramid. If you add a random extra person to the pyramid, it gets unstable and everyone falls down.Back to atoms though, as the atom falls apart, some of the fragments that fly off are neutrons. These neurons are typically moving very fast. The thing about fast moving neutrons though is that they are hard for other atoms to absorb. Occasionally an atom will successfully grab a passing fast neutron, but not very often. So a nuclear chain reaction is hard to keep going because most of the neutrons fly away too fast to split any other atoms.In a nuclear bomb, this problem is solved by packing a huge density of fuel atoms as closely together as possible. So, even though the probability of any one atom grabbing the fast moving neutrons is low, there's so many atoms that the probability of at least one atom grabbing each neutron is both enough to sustain a nuclear reaction.In a nuclear reactor, the problem is solved by stacking up layers of nuclear fuel in between layers of something else (like water or graphite) called a moderator. When a fuel atom splits, it releases fast neutrons which quickly fly right out of the fuel layer into the layer of moderator, which slows the neutrons down. By the time the neutrons get all the way across the moderator layer and into the next layer of fuel, they are moving at a speed slow enough to be easily absorbed.The nuclear bomb approach gives a device that is fairly lightweight but very prone to a runaway reaction and requires expensive premium fuel, which is perfect for a bomb but not really for a power plant. The nuclear reactor approach creates a device that is very heavy, but can run on low grade fuel and is much more controllable. Not great for a bomb, but good for a power plant.Prompt Criticality vs Delayed CriticalityWhen an atom of nuclear fuel falls apart it immediately leaves behind fragments including neutrons (called prompt neutrons), a variety of particles and whole unstable atoms. Some of these unstable atoms will then release more neutrons after a few seconds (the are called delayed neutrons). If exactly 1 of the neutrons (either prompt or delayed) from every fuel atom that splits causes one more fuel atom to split, then a stable chain reaction is occuring. If more than one neutron from each fuel atom causes another atom to split, then the chain reaction accelerates.For a bomb, we want the chain reaction to accelerate very rapidly. So we design the device to ensure that more than one of the prompt neutrons from every fuel atom causes another fuel atom to split. This causes the reaction to accelerate to maximum in a matter of nano seconds and release all its energy suddenly and destructively.For a power station, we want the chain reaction to be stable and only accelerate slowly when we want it to. To achieve this, we design it so that almost enough (but not quite enough) of the prompt neutrons causes another split. A chain reaction is then only possible if enough of the delayed neutrons also cause a split after a second or two. This delay causes the reaction to accelerate slowly and gives the operator a chance to use control rods to absorb some of the neutrons and keep the chain reaction at exactly the intended power.",2.0,Physics
2781,"Stars are held together by gravity and inflated like a balloon by their internal thermonuclear energy.For most of a star's life these forces balance out and the star keeps a stable-ish size.Near the end of its life, a big star starts fusing heavier elements and cranking out more energy than ever before.  This inflates the star ""balloon"" to many times its original size, even though the core has begun to contract under gravity.  These stars are huge, but practically hollow.  They fling off huge volumes of gas into space as the gravitational pull weakens while the energy output grows.At the very end, the star finally exhausts all its fuel and can no longer inflate at all.

Eventually, all the hydrogen is fused into helium, and the process repeats (core fusion working outwards).

This doesn't affect mass or weight; if there isn't any air around something that weighs one pound in standard Earth gravity still does, there just isn't ambient air pressure. Yes, space is a vacuum, but it isn't like people are floating around in space because space is a vacuum.But if we consider a lack of a strong nearby gravitational field to measure weight against (or a field of unknown strength) then we can measure mass by considering inertia. Objects at rest tend to stay at rest and objects in motion tend to stay in motion unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. That force of course can be measured precisely and the amount required to accelerate an object is directly proportional to its mass. In essence we try to jiggle the object and measure how difficult it is to do so. In that way we can measure the mass of an object without an appropriate gravitational field to facilitate weight.",20.0,Physics

It says F = -kx, where k is a constant that depends on the spring and x is the amount the spring was compressed.So if you coil a spring and use it to push someone in space, then m = -kx/a. k can be measured directly, x is pre-set by the device, and a can be directly observed via a camera.

When an electron absorbs a photon, it becomes ""excited"" - a technical term, and exactly what it sounds like. But an excited electron will quickly calm back down.

It's either going to become _heat_  - which is what happens when it's absorbed.  You've noticed probably that black things get hot in the sun.  Things that are white don't absorb the energy but instead ""resend it"" since it's got to go somewhere, which means it's reflected.   The wavelength of the object determines what gets absorbed vs. transmitted which is what results in us seeing things as different colors.So...the fundamental reason is becaues the energy of light has to go somewhere and some materials aborb the light and get all jazzled up and become hot (one way to deal with the energy of the light) and other materials just retransmit that light (a mirror) or some transmit some and absorb some based on wavelength causing you to see a color.",2.0,Physics

It's attracted to the nucleus (the nucleus is positive and the electron is negative) which causes a decrease in energy, and this emits a photon in this process.So it's not that light is bouncy, it's that light bumps an electron up to a higher energy level, which then goes back down to the original energy level, which emits a new photon that appears to have ""bounced"" off of the object.",2.0,Physics

Now at high temperatures these tiny magnetic fields point in random directions averaging to zero, and hence no magnetic field( generally there are clusters pointing in the same direction called ""domains""). Note that in iron the temperature for this to happen at is ~1,000K (Kelvin - 1K =1°C) that is why iron is magnetic at room temperature.

We couldn't get there just from visual observation of the Milky Way.As a teenager, I had the incredible privilege of recreating a piece of the early radio telescope observations with one of the guys who discovered the shape of the galaxy. Now I'm just a 60-year-old retired former English professor and lawyer with a faulty memory of the physics stuff I knew when I was a smart teenager, but I can try to explain.When you point your radio telescope at the night sky, you pick up emissions all along the radio spectrum. Hydrogen clouds emit radiation at a known spectrum, but these emissions get Doppler-shifted up and down in frequency depending on the movement of the clouded with respect to the Earth.(The Doppler effect is what makes an ambulance siren change in pitch as it goes by - high-pitched as the siren approaches, squeezing the sound waves, lower pitched as it drives away, stretching them out.)So back to the radio telescope. When you map out your emissions along the line in which you were pointing your telescope, you get several big bumps at certain frequencies. These are clumps of hydrogen clouds at certain distances. Actually, they represent a cross section of the spiral arms of our galaxy. But to build the whole picture, you have to repeat the process pointing your radio telescope at every point of the Milky Way.When they put this all together back in the day, they got a picture of vague lumpy and broken  bands of matter forming sort of elliptical ripples. It takes a lot of imagination (or genius) to see those early maps and say, aha, the galaxy is in the form of a spiral!It was very exciting, as telescopes and astronomical photography improved, to find evidence of other spiral galaxies in the universe. Today you can see a picture of dozens of spiral galaxies in a single frame.Radio astronomy has also improved. You have to know a lot of chemistry and mathematics to interpret the radio emissions it picks up, but it is how scientists detect and assess the chemical compositions of remote objects and clouds of gas. A lot of deep space images you see are visual reconstructions of data gleaned in this way.There - I've tapped out my knowledge in this area and probably committed some howlers in describing what I never completely understood even back in the day (I always sucked at chemistry) but hopefully enough for you to research more if you're interested.",4.0,Physics

2888,"When a car moves fast it needs to push all the air out of the way. This means that there is less air behind the car creating a low pressure area behind it. The car that follows will then have to push less air out of the way as the lower pressure creates less air resistance. It is therefore easier for the following car to speed up and this extra speed can be used to overtake the car in front. This is often refered to as a slingshot manouver where you place your car just far enough behind the car that you gain a noticable effect from the reduced drag and then speed up as much as you can without hitting the car in front before you swirve out to the side and let the extra momentum from the speed carry you past the other car allowing you to overtake.A disadvantage to driving behind another car, especially in NASCAR where the simple track layout and the strict specifications for the car means a lot of cars are stuck behind each other, is that the lower pressure air means the cooling is less efficient. So the following car tends to overheat more then the car in front. So sitting behind another car for long, even though it saves fuel, is not sustainable and you need to do things to protect your engine from overheating. Another issue which is mostly present in Formula 1 is that the lower pressure creates reduced downforce. So the car following may not take the corners at the same speeds as the car in front.

By the time the ripple reaches someone your hand is no longer where it was when it created that ripple. If it's fast enough the water turns into a splash. You are hitting it faster than the speed of water. Faster than it can get out if the way.When a jet flies really fast it produces a cone of sound. But once it reaches the speed of sound the air can't get out of the way fast enough and it creates a sonic boom.A radioactive material gives off charged particles like electrons and they fly away very fast. Typically slower than the speed of light. But, light travels more slowly in something like water. It slows the light enough that when the particle goes through the water it excites other particles and gives them enough energy to glow.

How do we increase the pressure/force on a rock sitting on the ground? We can push down on it, squeezing it against the ground. Water works in the same way. If you have a pipe of water, you can push on one end of it. If the other end is closed, the water is being squeezed: it is at a higher pressure. In real life, it might be the pipe system leading to your faucet. If the tap is closed, then it's being pushed on by the pumps or water towers or whatever your city is using to pressurize the pipes.

2956,"Because our brains calibrate everything we see to our own scale. This sometimes causes problems, like perceiving the moon as being bigger than it actually is when it is low in the sky.It takes a certain amount of time for us to take a step of a certain distance; a giant step would cross a larger distance. It takes a certain amount of time to move a lighter object, but more to move a heavier object. Since it takes more time for us to cross a larger distance or move a heavier object, our brains associate 'larger distance' and 'larger mass' with 'longer time'... so to fool our brains into seeing a 'giant' as larger than us, to see it as being more massive than we are, we need to slow it down. A giant moving at human speed just looks like a human... even placed against a correspondingly-smaller background, a tiny little village perhaps, moving at human speed would look totally wrong because from the scale of the village - the way we would be experiencing things, if we were little people in that little village - the giant's foot would be whizzing past at a speed that we ourselves aren't calibrated for. It looks fake. We must slow it down, make it fit our own experience of the world, to make it look reasonable.Correspondingly, a tiny character crosses much smaller distances with each step, so to fool our brains into seeing it as small it needs to move faster than we do.edit: spleling",13.0,Physics
2957,"Different reasons.Your muscle move your leg at a certain speed when you walk, a giant have larger step to make, so even if their muscle would be proportional to us, and they could move their leg at the same speed as us, they would have to travel a longer distance with each steps. So each step take longer, but they don't actually move at a lower speed, it just give that impression.Squared law. If you double the size of a cube, you multiply by 4 the surface area, but multiply by 8 the volume. This mean that a giant twice the size of a human, roughly have 8 times more body volume, which mean 8 times the mass, but it only have 4 times the cross section of muscle. The bigger the animal, the less strenght proportional to it's mass it will have. This is why large animal move slower, and small animal move faster than human. They have less muscle strenght by kg of mass.The two first things is how it work in reality and your brain know that by experience. You probably see larger or smaller things everyday for your entire life, so your brain know that large things move slow and small things move fast.

2959,"Intuitively, fictional things are usually modeled after real life things, and are made in a way that instinctively makes sense to our mind.So why would a giant human move in a slow manner? Well, because that's how we tend to see animals doing it. Elephants are the biggest land animals, and they're not exactly nimble. They're even physically incapable to jump. This is not by chance: as someone else has mentioned, it's the result of the square-cube law, which means a bigger animal would be proportionally to their size less strong than us, and thus will be less fast and agile. So a real-life giant would indeed be pretty slow and clumsy.",3.0,Physics
2960,"Because in the real world, small animals tend to move quickly relative to their body size, and big animals tend to move slowly.Think of a mouse or insect. It can scurry about very quickly, moving at way more body lengths per second than us, or than other, larger animals. Consider an elephant, for instance. It is large and lumbering and its movements are slower relative to its size.Let's look at some numbers to make this more concrete. Usain Bolt has a top speed of about 12 m/s, or well over six body lengths per second. A house mouse can run at over 3 m/s, but its body is less than 10 cm long, so it can do more than 30 body lengths per second. That's faster (by this measure) than a cheetah, which tops out at a measly 16 body lengths per second. An elephant has a top speed of about 11 m/s, relative to an average body length of about 4 m, so it can do about 2.5 body lengths per second.So, elephants are about as fast as humans (at top speed), but look a lot slower while doing it. Mice are slower than us but look faster. And it's all in these numbers of speed relative to size.Giants, if they existed, would be no different. They might outrun the fastest humans, but relative to their body size they would look slower. E.g. maybe your giant stands 10 m tall and runs at 20 m/s, which is way faster than a human. But, that giant still does only two body lengths per second, compared to our six. She will also be taking fewer, though larger steps. So, all in all, her movement looks a lot slower than those of a human running at top speed.The reason why bigger animals get slower compared to their body size has to do with square-cube laws that govern biomechanics. For instance, if you scale up an animal by a certain factor, its weight will increase with the cube of that factor, while its muscle cross-section (which governs its muscle strength) increases more slowly, with the square of the scaling factor (e.g. if you double the size, the animal's weight increases eight-fold while the muscle cross section only quadruples). This makes it harder for animals with larger bodies to apply the same force per weight to their limbs as a smaller animal (they could grow larger muscles to compensate, but only to a point). Their muscles and limbs are still bigger so they can put out more power and be faster on the whole, but relative to their bodies big animals tend to be weaker (and slower).(Of course this is only a general principle, and there is lots of variation between animals of the same size, depending on whether they evolved to prioritize speed.)",3.0,Physics

This whole thing as certain amount of energy.The energy then spreads out evenly.Cooling down water releases almost twice as much energy than heating up ice by same amount binds.Also the energy from melting the ice can not be used to freeze water.So usually water melts ice.If the system has more energy then the ice melts, if it has less energy the water will freeze.If you have much more ice than water, the ice is very cold or the water is very cold you can get situations where the water freezes instead.You can see this by dropping only a single drop of water on that -20 °C ice cube. The water drop will freeze.Edit: Napkin math says that you need at least 2.5 times as much ice (-20 °C) as water (+4 °C) for the water to start freeze.",3.0,Physics
2977,"/u/Nimradd this here above is the complete answer.It's also important to mention another aspect of temperature:The energy of a system is what determines what temperature, but the temperature itself is what determines the rate of heat exchange.(example: iron needs more energy than air to change temperature, but if both are at say 20 °C, both will stay that way, even though the iron has overall ""more"" energy, only the temperature equalizes, not the total energy) This will become important a bit below.Water doesn't freeze instantly at 0 °C, and it doesn't freeze for free. There is an energy requirement to change solid water(ice) into liquid water(well, water), all the while it stays at 0 °C, so if you put a certain amount of 0 °C ice and 0 °C water together, nothing will really change.This amount needed to change the state of the water is roughly equal to the amount needed to change water's temperature by 80 °C. This creates a really weird situation, because by the amount of energy needed for freezing/thawing, you could almost consider 0 °C ice to be -80 °C water. If you put equal amounts of 0 °C ice and 80 °C water, the whole thing would end up being 0 °C water. Thawing that 0 °C ice into 0 °C water took the same energy as cooling that 80 °C water to also 0 °C water.This is where the weird stuff happens, and you should re-read the top bolded part. That 0 °C ice is NOT -80 °C water(only has the same energy that cold water would theoretically have, if freezing wasn't a thing), so even though the 0 °C water has more energy than the 0 °C ice, because their temperature is the same, putting them together will change absolutely nothing. The ice will stay frozen, the water will stay liquid. If one was hotter or colder, the other half would compensate by freezing/thawing before moving away from the 0 °C point.Another important part: The specific heat capacity, the amount of energy needed to change something by 1 °C is half as much for ice as it is for liquid water, so if you wanted to add equal amounts of ice and water, and wanted no freezing or thawing to occur at all, the ice would need to be twice as much below 0 °C as your water is above.Considering all this, let's see what would happen to your -20 °C ice block and your 4 °C water(let's be lazy and make it 5 °C):If you add just twice the amount of water(at 5 °C) as your ice(at -20 °C), both will end up at 0 °C. Add a larger ratio of ice, and some of the water will freeze. Add a larger ratio of water(as is definitely the case with a common glass of water, with 1-2 ice cubes added) and some the ice will thaw.Yeah, thermodynamics is messed up.",3.0,Physics

2985,"Cold is the absence of heat. Heat always flows from a hot region to a cold region. That is an idea so basic that they had to go back and make it a law after they had already named the first law (energy can not be created or destroyed) so the law that heat flows from hot to cold is called the ""zeroth law of thermodynamics""So we know that a hot object will give its heat to all the cold things around it. There are three ways that heat can move. It can be conducted from one object to another just because the objects are touching. Also, heat will be conducted from the hot part of an object to the cooler part of the same object. To feel this in action, get a copper wire and heat one end. Copper is a great conductor of heat: you will feel the cool end warm up quite quickly.The second way heat can move is by convection. That is when a fluid, like air or water, flows past the hot object and picks up heat as it goes by. A hot fluid can also transfer heat to a cooler object that it is flowing past. In fact a car radiator is a good example of convection: hot water flows through the tubes of the radiator and heats up the metal. Then cool air flows over the outside of the radiator and picks up the heat and carries it away. Convection inside and outside.The third way to transfer heat is by radiation, and oddly, a radiator does not use this method. Radiation is the way heat from the sun gets to Earth even though the space between is a vacuum. The heat is carried by electromagnetic waves, including good old light, and waves not quite long enough for humans to see, called infrared waves. Light can travel through a vacuum, and it carries the heat with it. It is worth noting that to get any decent amount of heat by radiation, the hot object has to be really hot.",4.0,Physics

2987,Cold is the absence from heat (energy). If something becomes cold it loses heat to something with even less heat.,2.0,Physics
2988,"Cold isn't really a thing that physically exists.  An object is cold when it is a lower temperature (typically by a decent amount) than a reference point (often what's comfortable for a person).  When it's in reference to humans, there's the added caveat of it needing to be able to transfer heat relatively well (fun little experiment, put a piece of plastic in the freezer with a piece of metal and see which one feels colder after a few hours).  Heat flows from areas of high concentration (hot things) to areas of low concentration (cold things).The atoms and molecules in a substance are moving and have a certain amount of energy contained in them.  On a macroscopic scale, this is thermal energy.  So the molecules in a hot piece of metal are moving faster and contain more energy than the ones in a lower temperature piece of metal.  This energy is lost through three methods.Conduction: This is when a solid is in physical contact with another solid and the atoms transfer energy from one solid to another.Convection: This is when heat is transferred by moving fluids at a macroscopic level.  This can be a solid to a fluid (or vice versa) or fluid to fluid.  At an atomic or molecular level this occurs by atoms and molecules bouncing off of each other.Radiation: This is when individual atoms loose energy by emitting light (think of a hot piece of metal).  At lower temperatures this isn't much and is often way less than conduction and convection.  At high temperatures, you get things like the sun.  In space conduction and convection don't really work, leaving radiation.",2.0,Physics

If we didn't have that kind of springiness, it would take a lot more energy to run, since we would be wasting energy on absorbing the fall, then pushing off again.The Vaporfly has a springy plate in the bottom that acts just like our tendon in storing and releasing energy, except that it's much more efficient.

Beta radiation is a single, very high energy electron.Alpha radiation. Alpha radiation is the nucleus of a helium atom. Again, very highly chargedElectromagnetic radiation. Now, this is the interesting one, and the focus of your question.Electromagnet radiation is a wave of pure energy. It consists of two components - an oscillating electric wave and an oscillating magnetic wave; hence, electromagnetism. Think of old-timey space cartoons where the aliens have blaster rays that emit waves of pure energy - that's basically exactly what electromagnetic waves are.I'm sure you've heard of the electromagnetic spectrum - you start at radio, move up to microwave, then to infrared, then visible, then ultraviolet, x-ray, gamma, etc. These are all just electromagnetic waves - they're all just light rays. We can only see 'visible' light because that's the narrow band of wavelengths that we evolved the ability to detect.As the wavelength of the wave gets shorter and shorter, the energy packed into it goes up and up. Think of it like a spring - the tighter and tighter you wind the spring, the more and more energy gets stored in it. Radio is the weakest with very big wavelengths the size of buildings, and gamma rays are the strongest, with wavelengths smaller than atomic nuclei. Obviously the energy differences are huge.The lower parts of the spectrum are so weak that they don't harm us at all - they simply don't have enough energy to do anything to us. We can use things like microwaves and radio waves safely with no ill-affect. But, when you go higher up the spectrum, the waves begin to get so powerful that they begin to ionise atoms. This means that they have so much energy that they fly into atoms like a bullet and essentially shatter them, tearing them apart due to how much energy the radiation has. This is why radiation is dangerous - because it will rip through your atoms. Specifically, it rips through the atoms that make up the DNA in your cells, which tell your cells how to work properly. It can either destroy the cell completely, causing it and you to slowly decay, or it can damage the DNA enough to corrupt the cell and stop it from dying when it should - which is what we call cancer.X-rays take pictures of bone because X-rays are strong enough to pass through flesh and muscle, but they're not strong enough to pass through dense, thick bone. When you have an X-ray, your hand sits on a plate that's sensitive to X-ray light. X-rays are fired at the hand, and the X-rays hitting muscle and tissue pass straight through, leaving a mark on the plate, and the X-rays that hit bone don't get through, which means you get left with a negative imprint of what the bone looks like on the plate. That X-ray technicians hand looked like that because while one X-ray won't harm you, being exposed to thousands of X-rays will. Think about it, you only get one X-ray, but the technician is using his hands to set up that X-ray equipment dozens of times a day. He gets much more radiation, and those mangled hands are due to the X-rays damaging his DNA and stopping his bodies ability to heal.You can feel radiation if it's strong enough - it's usually described as a prickling, hot sensation on the skin, as well as a strong taste of metal in the mouth due to how it reacts with your taste buds. If you can feel radiation, though, you are very, very dead.Another note: beta and alpha radiation can cause the same effects as electromagnetic radiation, too. They will also rip through your atoms and cause damage to the cells, in strong enough doses.",8.0,Physics
3072,"There are three types of radiation.Alpha, beta and gamma radiation are three common types of ionizing radiation. There are others like neutrons, other atomic nuclei and even antimatter particles like positrons. This is just ionizing radiation.For nonionizing radiation, you have the electromagnetic spectrum below UV with visible light, radio etc.Even sound is a type of radiation ie energy transferred as a wave and so it gravitational waves",2.0,Physics
3075,"Radiation is something that naturally occurs in some atoms, iirc it's not entirely understood why exactly it happens but bigger atoms are generally more prone to eventually decay, when an atom decays it releases radioactive radiation.While there are multiple types of radiation generally you don't want to be near any of them, the main reason they are harmful is that radioactive particles can cause damage to your cells, causing them to die or mutate (at which point they can become cancers).",2.0,Physics
3076,"""radiation"" is a word that can mean a number of things.Most relevant for this question are electromagnetic radiation and nuclear radiation. (there is an overlap between the two).Electromagnetic radiation is stuff like visible light, infra-red, radio, microwaves, x-rays gamma-rays etc. the difference between those is their wavelength.You can see and feel some of these, like visible light. They can also hurt you if you are hit with enough of them like a laser.At shorter wavelength they can cause cancer.Gamma rays are the far end of short wavelength of electromagnetic radiation.Nuclear radiation are the sort of things created by nuclear reactions. this can be gamma rays, but also include alpha and beta rays.Where gamma rays are still the same stuff as light, alpha and beta rays are actually particles: hydrogen atoms and electrons going extremely fast.Alpha, beta and gamma rays have the potential to cause cancer if they hit you.Too much radiation especially the cancer causing kind is bad for you. However stuff like sunshine is also a type of radiation and we sort of need it to live even if too much of the wrong sort can give you cancer.",2.0,Physics
3079,The fusion that’s being going on the whole life of the start causing a large sustained nuclear explosion has been pushing against the stars gravity for however many millions of years in more or less a state of balance.Eventually the star will burn through enough fuel that it starts fusing stuff into iron. When this happens the fusion reactions stop releasing energy (due to Iron having the lowest nuclear binding energies) and the outwards force from the fusion reaction nosedives. Gravity promptly overcomes the forces from the stars core and the outer layers “fall” in. Very fast.,6.0,Physics
3082,"The gravity of the star constantly pulls all of the mass toward the center. While the mass of the star is a plasma, a lot of that mass and energy pushes particles apart and forces the star to expand. The star expanding and the gravity pulling eventually reach a relative equilibrium that keeps the shape and size of the star. When the reactions stop, the star stops expanding and gravity overtakes the force of expansion as it weakens. This crushes the star.It isn't a perfect overview; but, hopefully helpful.",2.0,Physics
3086,The universe is expanding in the sense that everything we've already seen is getting more distant. The rate at which it is getting more distant roughly corresponds to how far away it already is.,13.0,Physics
3087,Do you know the equation to how it corresponds? Like er=d×/÷?er: Expansion rate d: distance ?: factor,3.0,Physics
3088,"Not only is the distance between us and other galaxies growing in every direction, but the rate at which we distance is increasing. It's not only true for our galaxy - but all galaxies. (Some galaxies get closer to each other, but still they together distance from yet other galaxies.)If there is stuff outside the observable universe and everything is expanding in all directions from a previous middle - how would they have outpaced the speed of light?",5.0,Physics
3089,"Well, doesn't string theory say there was no big bang? And if it happens to be the true theory, there was no previous middle so it wouldn't have passed the speed of light. It would have already been there wouldn't it?",0.0,Physics
3090,"The expansion of the universe is actually quite logical if you consider the big bang blowing everything in all directions. What is interesting is that the universe is not only expanding, but the expansion is accelerating.We know the universe is expanding because every galaxy we look at (nearly all of them) are moving away from us, in every direction. The light that is just reaching us from the edge of the observable universe is so faint that we have no way of measuring it.For the sake of argument let’s say we can measure this light from the edge of the observable universe. We would know if the object emitting the light is moving away from us by looking at redshift and blueshift. In the same way you hear a change in sound when a car is passing, light can be shifted. If an object is moving away from us, the lines in the spectrum of the light (caused by the composition of the star) will be shifted to the red end of the spectrum. If the object is moving towards us the lines will be shifted to the blue end of the spectrum.If the light came from a source that wasn’t moving when it was emitted, the lines wouldn’t be shifted at all. So even if we could observe this light, it would still tell us that the star was moving away from us.",5.0,Physics
3091,I wonder if this is why the flash/Superman are often depicted/described as red blurs.,5.0,Physics
3092,"Both. Light has a finite speed, and as a consequence of that, it takes light time to reach us. Because of the age of the universe, there are objects so far away that their light hasn't had time to reach us yet. As time passes, this light will have more time to travel, and will eventually reach us. This is called the observable universe, i.e., the part of the universe that we can see because light has had time to reach us.The entire universe is also actually expanding, although it's not really correct to say it's getting bigger. In fact, not only is the entire universe expanding, but the rate of expansion is increasing. We can measure the rate at which galaxies are receding from us and each other, and the further away we look, the faster the expansion is happening. There are several ways we know the expansion is real, but one of the principle methods is by measuring the redshift of the light emitted from other galaxies. As space expands it stretches out light, causing it to appear more red than it did when it was emitted. We can see this light and compare it to what it it should be if there was no expansion, and thus confirm the rate of expansion.",2.0,Physics
3093,"Space itself is expanding, dragging galaxies with it. The further something is from use the faster it's going away, but it's not because we are special, this is what happen to any point in the universe. How to tell the difference? You know when you hear a race car or an ambulance go by, the sound is changing? Well that's the doppler effect, when a wave is travelling toward you or away of you, it's frequency will seem different to you. The actual wavelenght won't be different, but it will appear different to you, making that weird changing sound as the ambulance first go toward you, then away from you. Same thing happen with light, if will be blue shifted (mean it goes toward the blue side of the electromagnetic spectrum) if the source approach you, or red shifted when it go away from you.When light go through matter, different atoms will absorb very specific wavelenght of light. It's like a unique fingerprint for the atom. When we look at the spectrum of that light, they appear as little black lines in the spectrum and we call them spectrum or absorption lines. If we look at the spectrum of stars and galaxies we can see those spectrum lines slowly red shifting as we look at stars and galaxies that are further and further away. This show that they are moving away from us, but also that the further away they are, the faster they are going away.",2.0,Physics

3104,"So when you throw a ball, your hand goes faster than your elbow, and your elbow is going faster than your shoulder, right?So a whip is like a continuation of that, the tapered shape of the whip accelerates each progressive bit of the whip faster and faster as it gets smaller and more flexible as you move towards the end.  Eventually, if you whip it good, a part of the whip exceeds the speed of sound and you hear a 'crack'.  Doesn't necessarily have to be tip, though.",12.0,Physics

3106,Leverage. You arm moves 4 feet in an arc. The end of the whip travels 14+ or so in the same time frame. More distance traveled in the same period of time=exponential increase of speed.,6.0,Physics
3107,"Did you ever notice that hitting a ball with a heavier object, like a baseball bat, gives the ball much more speed than the bat itself? That is because the force between ball and bat speeds up the lightweight ball much more than it slows down the heavy bat itself.A whip uses a similar principle: If you swing the whip in the right way, the force of your hands at the grip is passed down its length in a wave. Now because the whip gets thinner (and lighter) towards its tip, the same force will act on a thinner and thinner rope, resulting in higher and higher speed. This gives the thin tip of the whip its ability to reach supersonic speed.Edit: Smarter Every Day made a video about this topic, where you can see this effect in slow-motion.",3.0,Physics
3108,"Another way of describing this is to look at a wave. The handle of the whip is large and heavy, so when you flick/throw the whip forward, the wave starts at the largest and heaviest part of the whip. As the energy is moving forward, the whip gets thinner and needs less energy to move it at the same speed, but because the energy is there it will make it go faster.Same thing as you see on the water, a wave in the middle of the ocean will only make little peaks and valleys, but once it reaches the shore, it will lift the small amount of water it there and let us surf on it.",4.0,Physics
3109,The base ball and the bat example is conservation of momentum in a collision.It has nothing to do with force acting on a thinner surface area.  The end of a whip moves faster because of leverage (as someone else pointed out). The thinner end probably helps with air drag but the leverage is the predominant factor (a think but short piece of string doesn't have the same effect).,0.0,Physics
